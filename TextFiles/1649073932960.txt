Bachelor of Technology (BTech) is a professional undergraduate engineering degree programme awarded to candidates after they complete four years of study in the field. Engineering is one of the most popular courses in India and there are many institutes that offer the course to aspiring students.
For admissions, the most common BTech entrance examinations are JEE Main and JEE Advanced. Along with these national level entrance examinations, there are many state and private level entrance examinations that the students can attempt for admission to the course. The basic eligibility criteria for BTech is class 12 with Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics. However, there are additional criteria in every entrance exam and institute. Some of the institutes also conduct admission to their courses on merit basis i.e. based on marks scored by candidates in their class 12 board exams.

Here is how you can prepare yourself to apply- 1. Make sure you choose the right degree. UK Bachelors and Masters are very specialised, answering diverse student interests. 2. Take into consideration course tuition fees: International students outside the EU (European Union) and EEA (European Economic Area) pay full tuition at UK universities. Also, non-EU/EEA students will not be eligible for loans and grants. Students from the EU/EEA used to pay the same fees as British nationals. But 2020 (and the first half of 2021) is the last year when they will have this benefit as well as the option to apply for student loans. Learn more about tuition fees in the UK after Brexit.

The maximum package availed for CSE is 42 LPA. PEP Classes- LPU provides placement classes to all the students from the very first year who opt for the placement. These classes help students for placements so that they can get selected in the pre-final year because the companies will start visiting for the recruitment of students from a pre-final year. Some of the students go for internships also in their final year. The Knowledge Review has rated LPU as the 10th best Training & Placement Institution in India.

As an alumnus of LPU, I feel proud to answer this question. I was a student in the B.Tech CSE of 2012 batch, the knowledge that I gained while my course duration has helped me a lot in shaping my career. In B.Tech, you have to study all the engineering subjects, But if you opt for B.Tech Hons. Then you have to study only one of the engineering subjects in more depth. So, in B.Tech you have to study all the subjects given by colleges. But in B.Tech Hons. You have to study only one subjects which you like the most and you get specialization only in one subject. So, according to my opinion, B.Tech Hons. Is the best option, In nowadays there is a very great demand for Hons. Degree. Choosing the best university with good placement is also important, I would recommend LPU based on the research that I have done by interacting with LPU B.Tech students. Let me share a few details of this programme at LPU. Good Placement: LPU has a good placement record for CSE students. Every year more than 500+ companies including national and multinational companies visit LPU for placement. A few of them are Microsoft, Amazon, Adobe, etc. In which they are placed. The maximum package availed for CSE is 42 lacs. Per annum by Microsoft in 2020. Scholarships: LPU provides scholarships to bright students every year worth crore rupees to all the students on the basis of their academics and extracurricular activities and other factors. Faculty: All faculty members are well qualified from IITs, NITs, Iims, and top-ranked universities all over the world.

The importance of Computer Science/IT cannot be undermined in the current times. This single branch of engineering has undergone a sea change and offers a myriad of career prospects to its students. Lovely Professional University is one of the best universities to pursue B.Tech. To commence with the curriculum, all the subjects you will study, their syllabus is designed keeping in mind the industry demands and company officials vet the syllabus. Different specializations are offered to students depending upon the stream they want to opt for. For example- In CSE, they provide cybersecurity, IoT, data Science, machine learning, and many more. Moreover, they give you the option for pathway electives: whether you want to be in the corporate sector, higher studies, Government Job, or entrepreneur. LPU has industrial tie-ups with numerous organizations for hands-on practical training and certifications in collaborations with the world's top brands. LPU has tied up with top companies to offer industrial training to B.Tech. Students at no extra fee. Right from Google, Microsoft, SAP, Bosch India to Amazon India, Tech Mahindra, Oracle, Cadence, Cisco, Lovely Professional University has the centers of excellence and tie-ups with many of the world's leaders and IT giants. And, this is how LPU ensures that its students are industry-ready and are accepted globally, in all streams. LPU has even tie-ups with companies like Upgrade, CompTia, Geeks for Geeks, etc. For a few B.Tech specializations. The University also provides the option of credit transfer and international exposure to their students. If I talk about the placements, the placement preparation is started from the very first year. Students are being given placement-oriented classes and even company-specific input also. Thousands of LPU students have got placed in top MNCs and are working all over the Globe. The highest Package Availed by Engineering (CSE) Student, Ms Tanya Arora is 42 LPA for batch 2020 by Microsoft. Students are placed in WorkIndia at 35 LPA; CLOUDERA at 31 LPA; AMAZON at a package of 30 LPA. An average package ranges from 5-10 LPA. Every year visiting companies escalate in number and till date University has recorded the highest placements in North India. The last is about extra-curricular activities. There is a separate division known as the Division of Student Welfare where there are various clubs that a student can join. Hope this helps! Thanks.

Dear Aspirant, Do not worry if you have dropped a year for the NDA preparation. You can take admission to the B.Tech (CSE) programme if you fulfill the eligibility criteria for the same. Many good institutes offer B.Tech (CSE) and every institute has its eligibility criteria. Being an alumnus of LPU I would share the eligibility criteria for B.Tech (CSE). To get admission you should have a minimum of 60% marks in the 12th class with mandatory subjects English Math, and Physics. Moreover, you need to qualify for the LPU NEST exam conducted by LPU. If you have not studied English as a subject, then you must have to provide proof of medium of instruction in English from your school or college. Also, you have to justify your gap of one year and it is not a big deal. I would like to tell you that the maximum package availed by the student for CSE is Rs. 42 LPA. CSE students get many specializations while studying CSE to enhance their knowledge according to their interests such as Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Cloud Computing, Cyber Security, Data Science, etc. I hope this helps. Good Luck!

LPU offers AI and machine learning. You would study AI in the 2nd year of CSE and you can choose ML as an Engineering Minor in the 3rd year of the B.Tech (CSE). I will try to answer your question to the best of my knowledge. Talking about Lovely Professional University, student of CSE here in LPU. LPU has a collaboration with Google to provide specialisation Android courses to the B.Tech/IT/CSE/Engineering students. LPU provides free training on SAP Business Suite to the students leading them to the SAP Consultant Certification. LPU has a tie-up with VMware IT ACADEMY for giving students and faculty exposure to products like vSAN, sphere, NSX, Workspace, Airwatch and cloud, including certifications. LPU was ranked SECOND by Hacker Earth leaving behind most IITs among more than 5000 universities, from all around the world. LPU students designed and created India's 1st Solar-Powered driverless bus which was featured in various national media and which made a maiden run in the Indian Science Congress 2019 held by LPU, which was inaugurated by The Prime Minister of India Shri Narendra Modi. And many more, with great placement opportunities, there is a very good holistic environment for one to study and get ready for the corporate world while sharpening your skills and knowledge. The placements at LPU are almost unexpectable. Someone gets a really good package while some get very less, it depends upon your portfolio and the interview. Mostly, the interviews matter a lot. If you did well over there you will definitely get a good job. Recently in the Amazon placement drive, 15-16 students got a package in the range of 11-16 Lacs and it's a good package, Tanya Arora got 42 LPA from Microsoft. But at the same point, there are some companies who took the students at the package of 3.5-34.5 Lacs. There will be many placement drives conducted by Tech Mahindra, Samsung, Koni Labs, Hitachi, Honda and many more. It depends on how you perform. Innovative and productive environment, more emphasize on practical sessions with the benefit of having ragging free campus.
