Aircraft maintenance engineering is not a degree or a Diploma course, but a training programme. On completion of the training, a license is issued by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA). And it should not be considered a valid graduation degree.

No you're not eligible for it. Diploma holders in aircraft maintenance engineering can acquire degrees on clearing the exams of the Aeronautical Society of India or if you did PUC based on JEE or JEE Main scores you can do.

Hello, no. NDA cadets have the option of studying Science or arts. There is no aeronautical engineering taught. This may be so because all cadets ultimately become fighter pilots and perhaps IAF feels that engineering is not required for these cadets. Best wishes to you.
