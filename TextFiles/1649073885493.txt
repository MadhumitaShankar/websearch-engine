The academics and placements are excellent. Awesome campus life, but the infrastructure is poor.

Placements:
IIM Calcutta is one the best colleges regarding placements. The college provides 100% placements for the students of every batch. The average salary package offered was 19 LPA to 20 LPA. Around 140-160 companies from finance, consulting, marketing, general management and e-commerce sectors visit the college to participate in placement drives. Each placement drive takes more than two days to record 100% placements, where the total number of students is 450.

Our college provides the experience which is worth the money and good placements and good education.

Placements:
Our college provides 100% opportunities for both internships and final placements. Top firms from various sectors like BAML, McK, BCG, P&G, Citi, GS, MS, JPMC, Brain, etc., dominate PE/VCs. Microsoft and other firms also offered roles across geographies and other profiles. Placements in IIM are most fresher-friendly, and also placements are mostly available in finance. Salary packages offered are not disclosed as it is a policy of IIM C and peer B-Schools. However, the highest stipend offered in...

This is a must join college.

Placements:
Placements in college are very good. Students are from diverse backgrounds and have a target role and industry which makes it difficult to attract companies. However, due to college brand, efforts and preparedness of students, almost 90% of the students end up getting their desired role and industry.

Infrastructure:
Being the oldest IIM, the infrastructure can't be an issue. We have been to foreign universities, and their facilities are not much better than ours. In addition, the campus has 7 lakes which make th...

IIM Calcutta - Joka of our Dreams.

Placements:
One the best colleges in the country when it comes to placements. Arguably no. 1 among IIMs in terms of placements. Has the maximum number of finance roles as compared to any other B-school in India. Here, you can get the best role in any sector of your choice if you are focused and determined to get the offer.

Infrastructure:
Infrastructure here has the best balance of nature and construction. The campus with 7 lakes has a lot of water bodies and greenery ensuring pleasant and serene environment. Being the first IIM it has many old buildings but a lot of state of the art buildings and a the latest sports complex have also come up in the campus recently. The artificial turf for multi sports and basketball court are the latest additions to the sports infra at the campus. The academic buildings are completely air condit...

The batch size is 450. The faculty is the alumni of Harvard and Stanford universities. The placement is 100%. The college provides high industry exposure and one gets chances to be a part of top companies' live projects while studying. Campus life is tough and hectic and IIM is considered to be the number one B-school in the country.

Roles were diverse from FMCG, consulting, finance, e-commerce, etc. The whole batch got an internship from campus. Stipends offered are competitive with the campus placements. You get to work in roles where you get a hands-on experience and hence, the learning is great.

This is the oldest IIM and also known as the "Fin" campus of the country spread over an area of 134 acres. It is the only B-school in India having triple accreditation. With a batch strength of 462 spread over 6 sections in the 1st year, this college has a heritage of delivering quality education. Is that all? Definitely no. 22 clubs starting from marketing club to dramatics club, all equally play a role in the growth of a person. The campus is also famous for its scenic beauty hosting 4 hostels...

IIM-Calcutta (as we lovingly call it Joka) is not a place, it is an experience.

Placements:
One word answer to placements is "exemplary". A batch of 450+ students getting placed in a record time of less than 3 days is in itself an achievement. I can't disclose the exact salary figures but they are good, really good in most of the cases. 100% placements are now an inherent characteristic of the institute. Nobody can question that.

Infrastructure:
It has the best fin lab in the country, best in class classrooms, one of the biggest libraries in the country in terms ...

Review of Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta.

Infrastructure:
A new academic block has come up to cater the burgeoning growth in the number of students. The sports infrastructure is also being revamped with floodlights being added to the sports ground. We still don't hav...

100% placements and the best faculty.

Placements:
100% placement is the norm in Indian Institute of Management Calcutta. Companies like P&G, HUL, ABInbev, Johnson and Johnson, ITC, Coca-cola, JP Morgan, Barclays Capital, Mahindra & Mahindra, ABG, TAS, Airtel, Reliance and many more have been regular recruiters of the brand they get from IIM Calcutta. The finance capital of India, as it's called, always attracts the highest number of offers from the leading finance companies.

Infrastructure:
World-class infrastructure. The classrooms are fully-AC with projectors and Wi-Fi in each one of them. The seating arrangement in the class is made in such a way that anyone with a physical disability would also find himself to be comfortable with it, for example, we have movable and revolving chairs which give ease with seating. The classrooms are designed in such a manner that it looks as a parliamentary session. The library is well-equipped with all the necessary books and the latest editions...

It is one of the best B-schools in the country simple because of the people on the campus.

Placements:
All students were placed both in finals and internship. However, concurring to the present market scenario, not all quality offers were made. All the traditional prime recruiters came but the number of offers was lesser than previous years. Hence, the placement mood is good but not the best.

Infrastructure:
The campus is beautiful in that it has numerous lakes and scenic beauty is good. But some of the hostels are very old and not repaired properly. Sports facility is not the bes...

Excellent and thought provoking, challenging and at the same time, provoking to learn more and more.

Placements:
The college had a 100% placement record with an average package of around 19 lakhs. Consulting and finance constitute nearly 35% of the batch and the rest of the batch was placed in the rest of the domain. Marketing was another sector which attracted many students as all the major firms came to the campus for recruitments.
