Manager Content


Clinical psychology is a broad branch of psychology that focuses on diagnosing and treating emotional, mental, and behavioural disorders. Few of the more common disorders that may be treated include learning disabilities, substance abuse, eating disorders, depression, and anxiety. The clinical psychologist meets with clients to recognise problems— behavioural, mental and emotional —in their lives. Through tests, interviews, and observation, the psychologist will identify any potential or existing disorders. Then, along with the client, they devise a programme of treatment as per the client’s requirements. Psychologists keep an eye on the client’s progress regularly to make sure that their needs are met by the course of action, and to regulate it if needed.
