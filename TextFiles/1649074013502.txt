IIT Hyderabad: college review/placement/hostels/course.

Placements:
Not many students were placed in core. If you or going for non core, placement was nearly 60% last year. Other people opted for higher studies/startups. Can't say much about the highest salary. Apple recruited one guy but he was doing double majors from CSE.

Infrastructure:
Classrooms are top-notch. The library is still in the construction period. Hostel facilities are good. The cleanliness, quality it serves is up to the mark. Personal rooms with sharing are there. Every facility is available for students. Cant...

Satisfied because of Infrastructure and Facilities provided to Students by IITs.

Placements:
Mechanical Engineering placements at IITH is nearly around 60 percent. The remaining students didn't get placed because they don't have good knowledge of coding or someone opt for higher studies. So, if you need good placements, just start coding from first year itself. The lowest package is nearly 7 LPA, the highest is 31 LPA. Top recruiting companies - Goldman Sachs, Oracle, Mathworks, Accenture India & Japan, Rakuten Japan, American Express, BNY Mellon, Celigo, NTT-AT, Publicizes Sapient, Jag...

IIT Hyderabad has good campus life and culture for students' overall growth.

Placements:
Many students get good salary packages from our college. Some students try for PSUs by writing their respective exams. Placements for CS and electrical are better than other branches. Many students pursue their post-graduation from renowned universities in other countries. Japanese companies are more active in visiting here for placements as there is a good collaboration between IITH and Japanese companies.

Infrastructure:
Most of the facilities which are necessary for students are available on our campus like Wi-Fi, library, medical help, canteen, mid-market, sports equipment and courts or grounds for all the games. Hostels have solar heaters, washing machines, elevators, fire extinguishers, fire alarms, water heaters for hot water and mineral water cans. Every hostel has one security guard.

The best college that I have ever seen.

Placements:
Placement in IIT Hyderabad is so much better than other IIT. The average package in CSE is 20 Lacs. The average package in other groups is 14 Lacs. Total 80% members are placed in every batch. I think it's the best place for coding. IIT Hyderabad stands 6th in placements.

Infrastructure:
IIT Hyderabad campus is next level in infrastructure. It was designed by the Japan architecture. I have seen so many IITs but the infrastructure of IIT Hyderabad is the best. But the college is not fully constructed but the ...

It is a preferable college over many others, and placements are also good.

Placements:
The majority of the roles are in specific branches like computer science and engineering and mathematics and computing field. Our college follows a very critical schedule for the overall placement process compared to other colleges.

Infrastructure:
The overall infrastructure is very well-planned and also attractive to many of us. Our college is located 50 kilometres away from the actual city. Hence it is not much preferably utilised yet. It does not have much related to sports activities.

Review of IIT Hyderabad - Indian Institute of Technology (IITH).

Placements:
Placements scenarios are awesome here as students have the freedom to choose our interest and gain excellence in that. It helps in our overall growth. Top recruiting companies like Google, Microsoft, Goldman Sachs, Flipkart, SAMSUNG R&D, many startups, Amazon visited the campus and offered a decent salary package.

Infrastructure:
First-class facilities in the gym, sports, library, labs, medical, Wi-Fi, hair salon are available inside the campus. A mess is good, but after some time you will get bored by the same menu. For first-year students, they provide p-block hostels due to lack of rooms, and from the second year onwards they provide the main hostel, and they are pretty awesome. They are made on Japenese architecture guidelines these hostel buildings have radiant cooling which not let the room get hot during summer. T...
