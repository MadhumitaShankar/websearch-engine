Hello! Sunil, It totally depends on your level of preparation. If you don't have enough knowledge of level 1, then you need to get different materials for the next level. But on top of that, remember that there are plenty of YouTube channels and online centers that provide the study materials such as unacademy. It's up to you that how you are willing to go for it. And as for NET 2022, not enough time is left. So, you need to gather the study materials and do self study. Along with this, solve as much as pyq's are possible. Hope this is helpful and ALL THE BEST.
