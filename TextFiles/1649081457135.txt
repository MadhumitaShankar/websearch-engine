When do I need a TV Licence?

What happens if I use the BBC when I’m outside the UK?


When do I need a TV Licence?
Page updated: 11 August 2017



That depends where you are and what you’re doing.







Inside the UK, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man

You need to be covered by a TV licence to watch or record live TV programmes on any channel, or to download or watch BBC programmes on iPlayer.
This could be on any device, including a TV, desktop computer, laptop, mobile phone, tablet, games console, digital box or DVD/VHS recorder.
We share some of your personal data with TV Licensing, to check if you are using BBC iPlayer and to keep their database to up date.
