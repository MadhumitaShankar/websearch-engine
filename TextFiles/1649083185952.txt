It’s the height of summer in Snowdonia, and for hill farmers that means shearing time. Although it’s an important job, it's also a chance for families and friends to come together.
Near Ysbyty Ifan, Beca Glyn and her family load their trailer to head up to the mountain where they shear their flock. Helping out is Beca’s cousin Meredudd, a superstar shearer who travels the world with his trade. Beca hasn’t picked up a set of shears in a few years, but she’s determined to improve her skills.
Geraint Davies has hired Hywel, an old friend and specialist shearer, to lend a hand. Geraint’s young daughters Kiti and Betsi are always keen to be involved, so are tasked with rolling up the fleeces. However, like most things in farming, there’s a knack which the girls will have to master if they want to become pro-shearers.
For Guto Davies, shearing day on his farm is very much a family affair, with three generations helping out today. Guto’s father, Gwyn, will corral the sheep, his brother Robin leads the shear, and his four-year-old son, Math, is also getting stuck in. In farming land, livestock and traditions are handed from one generation to the next, something Guto and his brother know well.
In the hills above Llanuwchllyn, Rhodri Jones has also been busy shearing his flock. With all the ewes and lambs done, the final job of the day is shearing the two pedigree Suffolk rams. However, these are big animals with bad tempers, so Rhodri has his work cut out as he wrestles the rams.
