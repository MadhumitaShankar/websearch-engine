What is RRB JE Recruitment?
RRB JE recruitment is a recruitment exercise meant to recruit the Junior Engineer (JE), Junior Engineer (Information Technology) Depot Material Superintendent (DMS) and Chemical & Metallurgical Assistant (CMA) in various Departments of Railways.
About RRBs
Railway Recruitment Boards were created initially with the name of service commissions and were created at different dates. Later in 1985, the Railway Services Commissions were renamed and restructured as the Railway Recruitment Boards. In the year 1998, all the RRBs came under the umbrella organisation Railway Recruitment Control Board (RRCB), which directly works under the Ministry of Railway (Railway Board). RRBs are responsible for the recruitment of personnel at various positions. They coordinate, recruit through a centralised recruitment advertisement and conduct online computer-based test (CBT) across the nation.
