If the project is under a parent WikiProject, a notice should be posted there as well. However, if editing can improve the page, this should be done rather than deleting the page. Disputes over page content are usually not dealt with by deleting the page, except in severe cases. The content issues should be discussed at the relevant talk page, and other methods of should be used first, such as listing on for further input. Essays, information pages, and other informal pages that are only supported by a small minority of the community may be moved to the over deletion.
