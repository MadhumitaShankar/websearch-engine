Becoming a lawyer is not the only job profile one can pursue after completing their law courses. Aspirants can also make their law careers in the mentioned below:

job profiles




Law Job Profile

Description



Lawyer

In this job profile aspirants are also sometimes referred to as advocates. A lawyer mostly represents one of the parties/ clients in a trial at court. As part of this job profile, one needs to cross examine witnesses and then list reasons/ facts around why the court should give the judgement in favour of their clients.



Legal Advisors

In this job profile, one is expected to counsel clients on legal rights and obligations. Legal advisors mostly research laws applicable to a particular case and thereafter go through previous judgements passed in cases similar to the one their client is currently facing and thereafter help them in listing out how they can defend themselves.



Judges

As a Judge one has to ensure that justice is administered and legal rights of all the involved parties are safeguarded. A Judge presides over trials/hearings wherein s/he has to listen to the case presented by lawyers.



Solicitors

Solicitors give legal advice and represent their client in legal matters. Solicitors mostly work for firms which take up cases related to their area of work.



Legal Executives

People opting to work for such a job profile typically advise their employers on legal matters. They also work on litigation cases for their firm. They also perform administrative functions along with handling in-house legal problems such as checking deeds, issuing writs, collecting information for affidavits as well as draft legal documents. Legal executives also represent their business house when they discuss legal issues with other firms.



Notary Public


Notaries are appointed by the central government for the whole or specific part of the country. The various State governments also appoint notaries who work for the whole or a specific part of the state. Any person who has been practicing Law (as a lawyer) for minimum ten years is eligible to apply for a notary post. As per the Notaries Act 1952, the function of a Notary is as follows:

To verify, authenticate, certify or attest the execution of any instrument
To administer oath to or take an affidavit from any person
To translate and verify the translation, of any document from one language into another
To act as commissioner, to record evidence in any civil or criminal trial if so directed by the court or authority
To act as arbitrator, mediator, or conciliator if so required



Oath Commissioners

Anyone who works under this job profile is authorised to verify affidavits. An Oath Commissioner is appointed by the Chief Justice and is usually (though not always) a solicitor. The functions of an Oath Commissioner are as follows:

Makes sure that the evidence in question is in written form (the draft affidavit)
Establishes that the person before him/her has read the draft affidavit and fully understands the contents
Makes a person swear that the affidavit is true by raising the appropriate Testament in the right hand and repeating the words of the oath
Verifies that the affidavit was properly sworn by completing a "jurat" on the affidavit

B.A. LL.B.Sc. LL.B. After this you can go for CLAT to get admission in NLU's, sidewise you can go for private colleges by looking at features and facilities. There are eligibility criteria also for all programme that do vary. Hope it's helpful, in case you need more details you can ask in more detailed way.

First things first, don't bother yourself with unnecessary or irrelevant internships. If it's relatable to judiciary preparation, then go for it. Don't try to do everything all at once. During the preparation phase, if one is engaged in some other necessary stuff, one tries to think of doing most of the syllabus in one sitting, However, you'll end up getting exhausted and when you look back, you'll notice that you have wasted your time. Make a timetable according to your day-to-day routine. Don't try to push yourself too hard. Preparation is a long term process, so pushing yourself is wise in cases like your exams are next week or something like that. Focus on a single task at a single time. Don't try to study whilst engaging yourself in some other business. You may feel like you can comfortably multitask, but there's no need to do so. Give your 100% to the task you are currently engaged in, whether it's studying, an internship or any other business. And always remember, no matter how good you may have had external sources and references, at the end of the day, it's you and only you. Prioritize doing regular revisions. The two main reasons why revision is so important are that, firstly, it helps with the recall of information that you would otherwise forget. To put it simply, it has the potential to greatly enhance your memory. Secondly, revising relevant topics three to four times enhances your confidence, reduces nervousness, boosts your confidence, and gives you a leg up on the competition. I hope this will work. All the very best!

I would strongly suggest that you go for internships that help you draft legal documents that ways you would develop judiciary examination papers along with the internships. Keep listening to audio lectures while working and you will have to work really hard. But that's worth it.
