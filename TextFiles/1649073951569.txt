Hi, it's very nice to hear from you that you are interested in doing your PG from abroad. Admissions abroad are not based exclusively on the academic performance but depends on many factors. It's best to approach an agency that is dealing with sending students abroad for PG. But most importantly you must study to understand the subjects prescribed and not for scoring marks. Best wishes to you.
