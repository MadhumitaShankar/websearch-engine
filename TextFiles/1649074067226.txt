The average salary for a Master of Fashion Management [MFM] is around INR 3 Lacs to INR 15 Lacs but this can be higher on the basis of experience and other factors. Don't dream of sky-high packages, though a few of them have managed to land a good placement though (11-14 LPA).

Dear Aspirant, Yes, it is worth studying in LPU, Punjab for B. Design (Fashion). LPU has a good infrastructure for this programme with quality of education. They have foreign faculty as well for this programme. One of my known also completed the same degree from LPU and working as a fashion consultant now. I will be sharing a few major highlights of the Fashion Design course based upon her experience. LPU School of Fashion has been ranked 6th best Institute in India and 1st in Punjab The School of Fashion Designing of Lovely Professional University is doing extraordinary works in the field of Designing. They are conducting Fashion Shows regularly for the students. It gives a great chance to the students to show their talent in front of a big audience. Prominent designers are also taking part in the events. So, surely it is a big opportunity university is providing to the students in LPU. The infrastructure for the practical works is very excellent in the university. Students can enjoy the course curriculum which has given more importance to practical knowledge. Scholarships have one other significance. Students can avail scholarships based on their score in the qualifying exam or according to their performance in the University test. The highest package offered for this programme at LPU is INR 9.55 LPA and the average package is INR 3.1 LPA. Companies visited for the placement at LPU are SOCKSOHO, IKARUS 3D, AMPLE, SAMARTH LIFESTYLE, WORLD FASHION EXCHANGE, INDITEX TRENT RETAIL INDIA PVT LTD, RELIANCE BRANDS, DA MILANO LEATHERS PVT. LTD. , PVH ARVIND FASHION PVT. LTD. (CALVIN KLEIN &amp; TOMMY HILFIGER), and many more. Anyhow you can enjoy the campus and course here and can excel in the field once you are completing the course. I hope this helps.
