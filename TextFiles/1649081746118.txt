Algerian president pardons 1,000 convicts

Detained activist Zaki Hannache is among those pardoned
Image caption: Detained activist Zaki Hannache is among those pardoned
Algeria’s President Abdelmadjid Tebboune has pardoned more than 1,000 prisoners to coincide with the holy month of Ramadan.
In a statement his office said an additional 70 protesters from the pro-democracy Hirak movement – who are awaiting trial for public order offences - would be offered clemency.
Among those released was a rights campaigner, Zaki Hannache, who was arrested in February for allegedly promoting terrorist acts and spreading false news.
The Hirak protests rocked major cities in Algeria starting in early 2019, forcing long-time president Abdelaziz Bouteflika to step down months later.
Protests continued even after Mr Tebboune came to power. He was rejected by the Hirak who regarded him as an extension of the old political system.

EU urged to treat African refugees like Ukrainians

Hundreds of African migrants die every year trying to cross the Mediterranean sea to Europe
Image caption: Hundreds of African migrants die every year trying to cross the Mediterranean sea to Europe
The head of the UN refugee agency has asked Europe to be generous and welcoming to other migrants, just as it has with Ukrainian refugees, following the death of dozens of African migrants at sea.
It comes after 90 people died in international waters of the Mediterranean sea after setting off from Libya in an overcrowded boat.
The medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières said that only four people were rescued from the raft on Saturday.
The UNHCR chief, Filippo Grandi, said Europe had hosted Ukrainian refugees “generously and effectively” and should consider the same for other refugees.
"It must now urgently consider how to apply this to other refugees and migrants knocking, in distress, at its doors" he on Sunday.
tweeted



Thousands of African migrants have been trying to cross the Mediterranean in recent years in search for a better life in Europe.
Some manage to reach their destinations but hundreds die each year in the perilous journey in overcrowded, often unseaworthy vessels.
The European Union has faced criticism for its close cooperation with the Libyan Coast Guard to cut numbers of migrants arriving on European shores.
Many migrants face further horrific abuses in Libyan detention centres on their return journey.

President Kais Saïed dissolved parliament earlier this week
Image caption: President Kais Saïed dissolved parliament earlier this week
The leader of Tunisia’s main opposition Ennahda party, Rached Ghannouchi, has been summoned for questioning by anti-terrorism police.
Mr Ghannouchi is also the speaker of parliament, which was controversially dissolved this week by President Kais Saïed - a move denounced by the opposition leader.
On Thursday, Tunisia's anti-terrorism unit summoned more than 30 politicians who had attended an online parliamentary session, in defiance of the president.
The session had been the first since President Saïed suspended the chamber eight months ago and seized wide-ranging powers.

The mass graves are thought to contain the bodies of migrants
Image caption: The mass graves are thought to contain the bodies of migrants
UN investigators have uncovered new evidence of mass graves thought to contain the bodies of migrants at a trafficking point in north-west Libya.
The organisation’s fact-finding mssion said the discovery - in the town of Tarhuna - provided further evidence that human rights violations in Libya are “widespread, systematic or both.”
The findings have been presented to the Human Rights Council.
Libya – a major hub for migrants trying to reach Europe - has been experiencing ongoing violence and instability since the toppling and killing of the country’s long-time leader Muammar Gaddafi more than a decade ago.

Tunisians have been protesting against their president
Image caption: Tunisians have been protesting against their president
Tunisian President Kais Saïed has dissolved parliament, which he following mass protests.
suspended eight months ago
It came after MPs convened online on Wednesday and voted to repeal presidential decrees that have given him near total power since last year.
The president termed the parliament's move a "coup attempt".
He said parliament had "lost its legitimacy" and had "betrayed" the nation - and the MPs responsible would be prosecuted.
Mr Saïed suspended parliament, assumed executive powers and moved to rewrite the constitution eight months ago. He has since ruled by decree.
Since then, anger at economic conditions in Tunisia has sparked street protests, some involving clashes with the police.

Rwanda takes in 120 migrants from Libya

In 2019 the UN called for the closure of Libyan migrant detention centres, describing them as unfit for purpose
Image caption: In 2019 the UN called for the closure of Libyan migrant detention centres, describing them as unfit for purpose
Nearly 120 asylum seekers have been evacuated from Libya to Rwanda in the first such flight of the year.
The group of men, women, and children - the youngest less than one-year-old - were from Eritrea, Sudan, South Sudan and Somalia.
Most had been living in urban areas of Libya's capital, Tripoli, and others had been arbitrarily held in detention, some for several months.
The group evacuated on Tuesday night will join another 269 refugees and asylum seekers in Gashora, where the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) provides assistance including shelter, food and medical care
“These evacuation flights out of Libya continue to provide hope and safety to refugees and asylum seekers trapped in Libya,” said Djamal Zamoum, the UNHCR’s acting chief of mission in Libya.
Detainees in various Libyan migrant centres have previously described routine torture, rape, malnutrition and the spread of diseases like tuberculosis because of conditions they are forced to endure there.
Campaign group Amnesty International had called conditions "horrific" and "inhuman".
The Libyan authorities responded by announcing the closure of three large detention centres in Misrata, Tajoura and Khoms in 2019.
Rwanda has taken in more than 900 asylum seekers since mid-2019 when it signed an agreement with UNHCR and the African Union.
Libya has for years been used as a transit route for thousands of people trying to reach Europe. The majority will try to cross over the Mediterranean Sea but many do not make it.
The International Organization for Migration says more than 215 migrants have been reported dead or missing in the central Mediterranean since the beginning of this year.
