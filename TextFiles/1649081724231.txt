An eight-carriage cargo train derailed as it was traveling from the Lualaba to Kasaï province, in south-eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.
Clémentine Lutanda, a local administrator in Lubudi district where the train began its journey, tells the BBC that seven people died and 14 were injured. Among the wounded, five have been admitted for treatment.
She also said that the train derailed on Sunday around 19:00 local time (18:00 GMT).
The National Railways Company, SNCC, has not yet said what caused the accident, but DR Congo's Transport Minister Cerubin Okende told reporters that an investigation is under way to find out.
In March, another train derailed in DR Congo killing 75 people and injuring 125 others.
The country's rail network is dates back to colonial times and remains in very poor conditions with regular accidents.

US expresses concern over reported massacre in Mali

Mali has been battling an insurgency since 2012
Image caption: Mali has been battling an insurgency since 2012
The United States has expressed concern over an "extremely disturbing report" that many people had been killed in central Mali last week.
that there were some conflicting accounts on the reported massacre blaming the "unaccountable" Russian Wagner group for many civilian deaths, while others pointed to the Malian armed forces targeting violent groups.
It said in a statement



The State Department said there was a need for the Malian transitional authorities to allow impartial investigations into the tragic events.
"Failure to provide a thorough and credible accounting of the facts and accountability will only serve to sow divisions in Malian society... and drive communities into the hands of violent extremist groups, and create conditions for more violence," it said.
Mali said over the weekend that it had killed more than 200 combatants in an operation between 21 and 31 March.
It came amid allegations on social media that dozens of civilians had been killed.

Long queues as fuel crisis persists in Kenya








AFP
Copyright: AFP
A nation-wide fuel shortage continues to bite in Kenya, with major towns reporting long queues at the few filling stations that have the commodity.
There are conflicting reasons as to why the shortage is being experienced.
President Uhuru Kenyatta says it is due to the global crisis occasioned by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The national oil storage company - Kenya Pipeline - says there is enough stock and the regulator EPRA warning any company hoarding the oil with deregulation.
Analysts say delayed subsidies promised by the government to oil marketers to cushion consumers from the effects of the global crisis is causing the shortages
