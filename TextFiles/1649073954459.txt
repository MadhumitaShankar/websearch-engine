Eligibility Criteria to Pursue Ceramic Engineering Course
Ceramic engineering is relatively a new and fascinating course in the domain of engineering courses that deals with the comprehensive study, properties, design and designing, manufacturing, applications and utilisation of ceramic materials. Ceramic engineering is a perfect combination of technology and art for aspirants who are creative and aim to study the flawless process of manufacturing objects from non-metallic and inorganic materials.
: To pursue in Ceramic Engineering, the eligibility criteria for admission is having passed XII examination from any recognised board with Chemistry/Mathematics/Physics as the major subjects, with minimum aggregate marks of 50 per cent.
Under-Graduation
BE/B.Tech
: To pursue in Ceramic Engineering, the eligibility criteria for admission is aspirants must have completed their BE/B.Tech in Mechanical/Production/Ceramic/Metallurgical/Automobile/Aeronautical/Marine/Mechatronics/Manufacturing/Industrial from any recognised university with minimum aggregate marks of 55-60 per cent (can vary from college to college)
Post-Graduation
M.Tech/ME
Skills Required for Ceramic Engineering Course
Ceramic engineers are specialised engineers who work with inorganic ceramics and non-metallic materials which are processed at very high temperatures. Ceramic engineers work with a vast range of products, spanning from electronic and glassware components to nuclear reactors and linings for jet engines and blast furnaces. Therefore, aspiring ceramic engineers should have a sound understanding of the policies and processes of working with several different forms of ceramic materials. The key skills required for pursuing a ceramic engineering course are:
