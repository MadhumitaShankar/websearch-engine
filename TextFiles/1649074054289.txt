Hi Payal, JEE Main And JEE Advanced are two different exams. If you want to take admission in IIT, then first you have to qualify JEE Main and then qualify JEE Advanced. By qualifying JEE Main you can get admission in NITs and other GFTIs colleges. JEE Advanced is tougher as compared to JEE Main.

Please don't panic at all. In the last month don't waste time on social media for motivation. Just revise the topic which you studied before. And do not start a new topic and complete those chapters first in which you will fill comfort. As the same situation arises in our case also I scored 85 percentile not to good but ya I got a TFW seat in private college so that my Tuition becomes zero. And I got a relief from the fee structure. At the last just focus on the scoring topic. And further if you find difficult I can mentor you.
