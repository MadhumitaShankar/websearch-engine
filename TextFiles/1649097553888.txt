Scope



[

This aims to:
WikiProject

tie in directly to to improve accessibility to high quality politics-related articles. The Portal is intended as a front page for Wikipedia's politics coverage, and should aid the reader in navigating around the articles. It should also draw attention to current events and some of Wikipedia's best politics articles.
the Politics Portal
support the Portal by ensuring that the Portal has plenty of high-quality articles to showcase and ensuring that readers starting with the Portal can find their way around easily
be as good in breadth as it is in depth. The namespace 'Politics' is rather broad, so although politics coverage can be augmented by more detailed projects, this particular project should oversee coverage – this will involve making sure that the articles are well organised (through the use of categories) and ensuring that due attention is paid to the further reaches of the topic - for example, more obscure political theory. For the Portal, this should involve rotating the featured article and biography – rotating through domestic politics, international relations and political theory could be one way of doing this
all
be truly international – this project particularly welcomes participants from non-Anglophone countries. The Portal should be used to highlight articles that concern political issues that most readers may not be aware of, and these are far less likely to concern, say, American politics
Oversee the development of politics-related articles
Provide a clear structure of how politics articles are arranged on Wikipedia and present the Portal so as to facilitate reading and research
Coordinate efforts and peer review articles

Tasks



[
edit
]

Compile all templates, infoboxes and categories relating to the coverage of politics and link to them via this page (use a subpage if the list will be too long)
Assemble a list of all featured content
Advertise like mad! Add link to the politics portal on as many politics pages as possible – checklist , please expand in any way you see fit
Wikipedia:WikiProject Politics/Add Portal List
That's all for now, but please add to this list if you have further ideas on how to get this project and Portal up and running!
