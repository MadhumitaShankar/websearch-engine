What is Dolby Atmos music?




Dolby Atmos is an innovative audio technology that envelops you in an immersive listening experience. While music mixed in stereo is limited to left and right channels, music created in Dolby Atmos is freed from channels, allowing artists to place individual sounds all around you. Artists can also decide the volume, size, and vibrancy of each instrument to reveal nuanced details in the music.



How can I listen to Dolby Atmos music?




Apple Music subscribers using the latest version of Apple Music on iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV can listen to thousands of Dolby Atmos music tracks using any headphones. When you listen with compatible Apple or Beats headphones, Dolby Atmos music plays back automatically when available for a song. For other headphones, go to Settings > Music > Audio and set Dolby Atmos to Always On. You can also hear Dolby Atmos music using the built?in speakers on a compatible iPhone, iPad, MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, or iMac, or by connecting your Apple TV 4K to one of the following: HomePod speakers set up as the default speakers, a Dolby Atmos compatible sound bar, a Dolby Atmos enabled AV receiver, or a television that supports Dolby Atmos audio. For full list of compatible devices, please see . Dolby Atmos is not available with Apple Music Voice Plan.

What is lossless audio?




Lossless audio compression reduces the original file size of a song while preserving all of the data perfectly. Apple Music is making its entire catalog of more than 90 million songs available in lossless audio at different resolutions. In Apple Music, “Lossless” refers to lossless audio up to 48kHz, and “Hi-Res Lossless” refers to lossless audio from 48kHz to 192kHz. Lossless and Hi-Res Lossless files are very large and use much more bandwidth and storage space than standard AAC files. Lossless audio is not available with Apple Music Voice Plan.

How can I listen to lossless audio?




You can listen to lossless audio using the latest Apple Music app on an iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple TV. Turn on lossless audio in Settings > Music > Audio Quality. You can choose between Lossless and Hi-Res Lossless for cellular or Wi-Fi connections. Note that Hi-Res Lossless requires external equipment such as a USB digital to analog converter.



Can I share with my family?




Yes. With an Apple Music Family Plan, up to six people in the family can enjoy all the features and the full catalog of Apple Music. To get started, just set up Family Sharing on your iOS or iPadOS device, Android phone, or Mac and invite family members to join.



Is there an Apple Music student subscription?




Students get the same Apple Music features and benefits as individual members. Once your student status with your college or university is verified, you get student membership pricing for up to four years, as long as you remain a student. After four years, your membership will continue at the individual member price.



Are there commercials?




Apple Music has zero ads.



Is Apple Music the same as iTunes?




Your iTunes library is still yours. You can access your entire collection from Apple Music or from iTunes for macOS or Windows.
