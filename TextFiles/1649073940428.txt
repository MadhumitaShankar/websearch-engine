Hello Manjunatha, perhaps I am hearing for the first time that someone doing Ph.D. or intending to do it is enquiring about placements. Normally speaking, one associates placements with graduation and not even PG. This is so since opportunities gets thinned out. Also by then one has invariably worked at few or many establishments and can negotiate better. Hence I feel that you should not worry about it. I am sure, even before completion of your Ph.D. you will get job offers. This is so since prospective employers always keep on the look out for highly qualified professionals. Best wishes to you.

During graduation in my final year my friends used to earn amount by working as a freelancer on internet. The freelancer work could be easily managed in weekend and was able to provide them a handsome amount. Also one can earn by teaching in coaching classes for competitive exams and boards. Some of my friends hosted website and used to earn through google ads. As far as campus placement is considered let me tell you that CGPA decides only your eligibilty criteria for sitting in campus placement. For the rest of the process your core mechanical knowledge and confidence matters. I have seen candidates having cpi of 5 being placed in reputed companies. You have plenty of time before the college ends. You need to evaluate yourself, identify your strengths and weakness, improve upon your weakness, use your strengths as your main weapon. Prepare atleast two subjects as your area of interest for interviews. Be aware of the latest developments in those two subjects. And the most important, communication skills which decide the entire game so take care of that also. At last be patient and calm cause success will knock your door, maybe not early but definitely.

Mechanical engineering is best studied at Chandigarh University, located in Punjab. The National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) has rated Chandigarh University as A+. Mechanical engineering is the art and Science of designing, developing, and controlling frameworks and parts based on liquid mechanics, material Science, Thermodynamics kinematics. Mechanical engineering is also known as mechanical design or mechanical engineering. In order to configure, test, and assemble various types of equipment, mechanical engineers employ these fundamental concepts in conjunction with tools such as computer-aided design (CAD) and item lifecycle management. Mechanical Engineering is widely regarded as one of Punjab's most essential mechanical design schools. India has built a strong brand reputation in the region by supplying trained personnel in recent years. Mechanical Engineering is widely regarded as one of Punjab's most crucial mechanical design schools. The university is currently holding its placement drive for the class of 2022, and over 757 recruiters have made more than 7500 offers. The highest package, worth INR 52.11 LPA, is offered by Charter Global, the most expensive. During the summer internship placement drive for the batch 2020-22 at Chandigarh University, the students offered the highest internship stipend of INR 1 Lac per month. Microsoft, Google, Amazon, IBM, Adobe, Deloitte, Morgan Stanley, Qualcomm, and many other companies are among the top recruiters globally.

Hello Bandana Kalita, getting admission in any university abroad is not as straightforward as in India. There, admissions are based on wide spectrum of parameters and not exclusively on academics. Hence I would like to advise you to approach an agency that is dealing with sending students abroad....
