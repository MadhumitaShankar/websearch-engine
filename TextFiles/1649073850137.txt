Do the students who get placed in a company from Lexicon Mile get a chance to appear for other companies as well or is it limited?

Hi, Many Management institutes do not allow students to appear for companies if they are already placed. However this is the internal communication of the college and would be known better to the one who have studied from this particular institute. In few cases if all the students are placed and still companies are coming students can sit for placements. Also few colleges have a team which work for placement of college and bring companies, the team members are also given 2 chances to sit for 2 companies in few colleges

Hello MILE is definitely not the best choice for pursuing PGDM since neither it offers great placements nor is it an established brand. SIBM, SCMHRD, and Pumba are the top three MBA colleges in Pune.

Hey! the core difference between MBA and PGDM will help you understand which is better- MBA is a Degree awarded by universities and PGDM is a Diploma awarded by autonomous institutions. As far as career growth is concerned, there is no difference between the two. It would depend on your performance rather than stressing on the fact whether you pursued PGDM or MBA. Since PGDM courses are offered by institutions, they provide an upgraded and industry oriented curriculum whereas in MBA, the syllabus is rigid which is not continuously enhanced by the University also. Although it can be safely said that a degree from an affiliated university generates more brand value. I hope this will help you!

PGDM in Pune has greater scope than others because it provides you more options about career choice and universities. Also after completing it you will get recognized by many recruiters and private firms that will hire you.

Dear, It is a chance to get admission there, but don't wait. Just apply for it. And, you can also wait for some time to check the cutoff list. You can make a contact with admission officials. All the best.

Frankly speaking, both are more or less same in terms of being good and reputed colleges of Pune in terms of education, placements and ROI. But personally, I'll suggest to go with Balaji as the corporate culture is better and lots of learning opportunities are there. But since you've asked about lexicon - yes, it's a good option because the focus will be on overall development of students and decent placements. If possible, you should personally visit the campus to know better.
