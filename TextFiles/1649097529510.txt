Since some websites delete or move old webpages, it's best to archive the webpage AND add it to your references. This future-proofs your references, because if the old webpage goes away, then Wikipedia still has access to an archived copy. : 1) open up first webpage that you plan to use in your reference, 2) open up a second webpage to 3) paste first webpage box on right side under "Save Page Now" then press "Save Page" button and wait archive.org to backup the webpage, 4) open up wikipedia article that needs the reference, 5) edit the article, 6) click the cursor where you need to insert the reference, 7) choose a "Cite" template at the top of the edit window, 8) click "Show/hide extra fields" button (to show archive fields), 9) fill in fields, 10) click "Preview" button to make sure you haven't made a mistake, 11) click "Insert" button to insert the reference citation text into the edit window.
