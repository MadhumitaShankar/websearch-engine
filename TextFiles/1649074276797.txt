Safari
Blazing fast. Incredibly private.










Safari is the best way to experience the internet on all your Apple devices. It brings robust customization options, powerful privacy protections, and industry-leading battery life — so you can browse how you like, when you like. And when it comes to speed, it’s the world’s fastest browser.

More with the battery. Less with the loading.


With a blazing-fast JavaScript engine, Safari is the world’s fastest browser. It’s developed to run specifically on Apple devices, so it’s geared to make the most out of your battery life and deliver long-lasting power. And with Apple silicon, it’s even faster than ever before.

4K video streaming

See your favorite shows and films in their best light. Safari now supports in-browser 4K HDR video playback for YouTube, Netflix, and Apple TV+. And it runs efficiently for longer-lasting battery life.

Privacy
Privacy is built in.

Online privacy isn’t just something you should hope for — it’s something you should expect. That’s why Safari comes with industry-leading privacy protection technology built in, including Intelligent Tracking Prevention that identifies trackers and helps prevent them from profiling or following you across the web. Upgrading to iCloud+ gives you even more privacy protections, including the ability to sign up for websites and services without having to share your personal email address.

Intelligent Tracking Prevention






Safari stops trackers in their tracks.







More

Intelligent Tracking Prevention

What you browse is no one’s business but your own. Safari has built?in protections to help stop websites and data-collection companies from watching and profiling you based on your browsing activity. Intelligent Tracking Prevention uses on-device intelligence to help prevent cross-site tracking and stops known trackers from using your IP address — making it incredibly difficult to learn who you are and what you’re interested in.




Privacy Report

Safari makes it simple to see how your privacy is protected on all the websites you visit. Click the Privacy Report button in your toolbar for a snapshot of cross-site trackers currently prevented from profiling you on the website you’re visiting. Or view a weekly Privacy Report to see how Safari protects you as you browse over time.


















Customization
Putting the you in URL.

Safari is more customizable than ever. Organize your tabs into Tab Groups so it’s easy to go from one interest to the next. Set a custom background image and fine-tune your browser window with your favorite features — like Reading List, Favorites, iCloud Tabs, and Siri Suggestions. And third-party extensions for iPhone, iPad, and Mac let you do even more with Safari, so you can browse the way you want across all your devices.




















Tab Groups

Save and organize your tabs in the way that works best for you. Name your Tab Groups, edit them, and switch between them across devices.



















Extensions

Safari Extensions add functionality to your browser to help you explore the web the way you want. Find and add your favorite extensions in the dedicated Safari category on the App Store.

Smart Tools
Designed to help your work flow.


New built-in tools let you interact with the web like never before, creating a browsing experience that’s far more immersive, intuitive, and immediate. Get detailed information about a subject in a photo with just a click, select text within any image, instantly translate an entire web page, and quickly take notes wherever you are on a site — without having to switch apps.



















Quick Note

Notes is your go-to app to capture any thought. And with the new Quick Note feature, you can instantly jot down ideas as you browse websites without having to leave Safari.



















Translation

Translate entire web pages between eight languages with a single click.


Hallo
Hola
Bonjour
Hello

Live Text

Interact with text in any image on the web using functions like copy and paste, lookup, and translate.

Visual Look Up

Quickly learn more about landmarks, works of art, breeds of dogs, and more with only a photo or an image you find online.


















Security
Surf safe and sound.

Strong security protections in Safari help keep you safe. Like iCloud Keychain, which securely stores and autofills your passwords across all your devices. If a password breach is detected, Password Monitoring alerts you. Safari also notifies you when it encounters suspicious websites and prevents them from loading. Because it loads each web page in a separate process, any harmful code is always confined to a single browser tab so it won’t crash the entire application or access your data. And now Safari automatically upgrades sites from HTTP to the more secure HTTPS when available.


















Password Monitoring


If your password is involved in a data breach, Password Monitoring alerts you and helps you change your password.








More about password security

Password Monitoring

Safari automatically keeps an eye out for any saved passwords that may have been involved in a data breach. Using advanced cryptographic techniques, Safari periodically checks a derivation of your passwords against an updated list of compromised credentials. If a breach is discovered, Safari helps you upgrade your existing passwords. All this is done without revealing your password information to anyone — including Apple.




Apple Pay

Apple Pay is the easiest and most secure way to shop on Safari — allowing you to complete transactions with Face ID or Touch ID on your iPhone or iPad, with Touch ID on your MacBook Pro or MacBook Air, or by double-clicking the side button on your Apple Watch. Your credit card details are never shared, and your transactions are protected with industry-leading security.

Continuity
Same Safari. Different device.


Safari works seamlessly and syncs your passwords, bookmarks, history, tabs, and more across Mac, iPad, iPhone, and Apple Watch. And when your Mac, iOS, or iPadOS devices are near each other, they can automatically pass what you’re doing in Safari from one device to another using Handoff. You can even copy images, video, or text from Safari on your iPhone or iPad, then paste into another app on your nearby Mac — or vice versa.

Tab View
Reading List
iCloud Keychain

















































Tab View.
When you use Safari on multiple devices, your tabs carry over from one Apple device to another. So you can search, shop, work, or browse on your iPhone, then switch to your iPad or Mac and pick up right where you left off.

Reading List.
Save web pages you want to read later by adding them to your Reading List. Then view them on any of your iCloud-connected devices — even if you’re not connected to the internet.

iCloud Keychain.
iCloud Keychain securely stores your user names, passwords, and credit card numbers and keeps them up to date on your trusted devices. So you can easily sign in to your favorite websites — as well as apps on iOS and iPadOS — and quickly make online purchases.














Designed for developers.

Deep WebKit integration between Mac hardware and macOS allows Safari to deliver the fastest performance and the longest battery life of any browser on the platform, while supporting modern web standards for rich experiences in the browser. WebKit in macOS Monterey includes optimizations that enable even richer browsing experiences.
