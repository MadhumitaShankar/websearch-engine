Wikipedia:WikiProject Council/Guide § Dealing with inactive WikiProjects
Many WikiProjects fall inactive or semi-active because they have a lack of interested editors or they simply have served their initial purpose. Many small scope projects fall inactive or semi-active after establishing an organizational structure, , , layout and inclusion standards, reliable sources, and navigational aids. These projects are retained for reference as they may be viable because they provide topic-specific considerations of the many site-wide policies and guidelines that still apply to a subsets of articles.

Any editor can contribute to this process at any time. In addition, many WikiProjects contain '' and/or '' notification sections which continue to serve a useful purpose by displaying automated, up-to-date activity notifications, irrespective of the level of current editor engagement with the Project pages.
