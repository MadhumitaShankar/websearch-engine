If you are a fresher, then I would recommend getting any job or giving entrances like CAT XAT MAT SNAP etc. This year. If you want colleges only in Bangalore city, try giving MAT. It is generally scheduled 4 times a year. So you can definitely give it a shot. Also, getting a chance in better colleges will enhance your job opportunities. So choose wisely. As doing MBA is quite expensive.

There are few colleges that accept applications without any test score. You can check NMIMS or IGNOU. But if you are a fresher then it would be very beneficial for you to take admission in a reputed institute with a good entrance test score.
