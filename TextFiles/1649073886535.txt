The college is quite rigorous.

Placements:
Placements in our college are quite satisfactory as per the trend in other B-schools. From my batch, everyone was able to get a summer internship in various prestigious firms. The same goes for the final placements of the second year batch. Most of the students got placed during lateral placements only, and the rest were placed during the final placemat week.

Infrastructure:
The infrastructure of our college is quite good as a B-school. The campus has its own playgrounds, auditorium, faculty building and residen...

Review of IIM Lucknow - Indian Institute of Management (IIML).

Placements:
The college has provided 100% placements for both the batches. It is on par with other old IIMs. Consulting and finance companies visit the campus in less volumes, but a good number of industries visit the campus during the placement season. Maximum companies offer sales and marketing roles to the students. Quantitative and research-oriented roles are to be offered more. There is a hardworking placement committee that looks after the placement process.

Infrastructure:
All the requirements from classrooms, sports...

Review of IIM Lucknow - Indian Institute of Management (IIML).

Placements:
This is one of the few MBA schools to offer very good placements. There are 100% placements with very reputed companies coming in to take candidates for both the summer internships and final placements. The students here actually have the advantage as they get to choose the companies for themselves rather than the other way round which happens in most of the other B-schools across the country. This is what makes IIM Lucknow one of the best colleges for MBA education.

Infrastructure:
Concerning its infrastructure...

In a nutshell, this college is extremely good in terms of placements, infrastructure and faculty.

Placements:
Placements for this course are similar to that of the regular PGP course. There were almost 100% placements for the 2019 batch. However, the highest and the lowest salary packages are not disclosed by the college. Some notable companies like BCG, HUL, P&G and JPMC visit the campus. Most of the roles offered are in sales and marketing domains, followed by finance and consulting.

Infrastructure:
There are smart classrooms with centralised A/C facilities. Power backup is available in case of electricity failure. Th...

Review of IIM Lucknow - Indian Institute of Management (IIML).

Placements:
Placements are in particular with PGP students. In 2019, it has proven to surpass PGP placements may be due to the low batch size. Consulting, finance, marketing, agriculture, supply chain management and HR roles were offered to the students, with the number of roles is highest in consulting and marketing fields.

Infrastructure:
The infrastructure of our college is up to the mark considering the fee charged. Various services right from basic necessities to high-end requirements all are present at the doorstep. C...

Review regarding Indian Institute of Management Lucknow.

Placements:
Placement is very good here. Many top countries of the country come here for placements. Even though it is called a marketing campus, students aspiring for consulting, or finance also get placed easily in top firm of the country. Placements in operations is moderate.

It's a huge campus with lots of trees in it. Weather is extreme here both summer and winter. Single accommodation hostel rooms for each student in both years. Library is huge, nice and clean. Academic buildings are also very clean with AC classrooms and comfortable seating. Campus has a lot of greenary with full of wildlife. One can easily notice peacocks and other birds roaming jnthe campus. There are also porcupine in the campus and my friends have noticed the creature. Also this campus is ful...

Amazing infrastructure and placements.

Placements:
Around 100% placements are achieved within 2-3 days of the placement season. Summer internship drives have been concluded in 2 days this year. Same trends are often followed every year with being a little early or a possible delay. All the students got internships, and almost 30% of them were offered PPOs. The average salary package offered isn't to be disclosed, but it hovers around 16-19 LPA.

The infrastructure of our college is amazing. It is one of the biggest management campuses in India. Ev...
