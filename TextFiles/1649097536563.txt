Categories for discussion
The central goal of the category system is to provide navigational links to Wikipedia pages in a hierarchy of which readers, knowing essential——characteristics of a topic, can browse and quickly find sets of pages on topics that are defined by those characteristics.

Further information:
Wikipedia:Category names
When naming a category, one should be particularly careful and choose its name accurately. Moving non-conventionally categorized pages to another category name (see {{}}) imposes an additional overhead – an edit for article and subcategory.

General conventions



Standard article apply; in particular, do not capitalize regular nouns except when they come at the beginning of the title.
naming conventions
Names of should be singular, normally corresponding to the name of a Wikipedia article. Examples: "", "", "".
topic categories
Law
France
Hillary Clinton
Names of should be plural. Examples: "", "".
set categories
Writers
Villages in Poland
Avoid abbreviations. Example: "", not "Category:Military equipment of WW2". However, abbreviations that have become the official or generally used name (such as ) should be used where there are no other conflicts.
Category:Military equipment of World War II
NATO
Do not write the category structure in names. Example: "", not "People – Monarchs". This includes creating categories that are subpages of other categories.
Monarchs
Choose category names that can stand alone, independent of the way a category is connected to other categories. Example: "", not "Terminology" (a subcategory of "").
Geography terminology stubs
Geography stubs
As with , avoid descriptive adjectives such as , , or in category titles.
lists
famous
important
notable
Particularly for technical subjects, use words and phrases which exist in reliable sources, so that those sources may be used to support inclusion of articles.
When an article topic requires disambiguation, any category eponymously named for that topic should include the same form of disambiguation, even if no other articles are likely to have an eponymous category.

Special conventions



Note that in many instances a topic category and a set category have similar names, the topic category being singular and the set category plural. For example, is a topic category (containing all articles relating to the topic), while is a set category (containing articles about specific operas). Be careful to choose the right one when categorizing articles.
Opera
Operas
If there are a lot of in a particular subject area, it may be useful to have a category to hold them, called something like "". These categories should only contain list pages (for example "", ""). When placing pages in such a category, use a that excludes the phrase "List of" (otherwise all lists would appear under "L"). See also .

Do this by editing the article page. At the bottom, but before the (if any are present), add the name of the new category, (e.g.: ), and save your edit. The as-yet-undefined category name will now appear as a red link in the article's category list at the bottom of the page.

Next, to create the category, click on that red link, which brings you back into the editor. Adding this new category into the appropriate parent category is much the same as with an article: at the bottom, simply add the parent category (e.g.: ), which should usually be a of the sub-category.

Sometimes, a common-sense guess based on the title of the category isn't enough to figure out whether a page should be listed in the category. So, rather than leave the text of a category page empty (containing only parent category declarations), it is helpful – to both readers and editors – to include a description of the category, indicating what pages it should contain, how they should be subcategorized, and so on.
In such cases, the desired contents of the category should be described on the category page, similar to how the are described in a stand-alone list. The category description should make direct statements about the criteria by which pages should be selected for inclusion in (or exclusion from) the category. This description, not the category's name, defines the proper content of the category. Do not leave future editors to guess about what or who should be included from the title of the category. Even if the selection criteria might seem obvious to you, an explicit standard is helpful to others, especially if they are less familiar with the subject.
list selection criteria
The description can also contain links to other Wikipedia pages, in particular to other related categories which do not appear directly as subcategories or parent categories, and to relevant categories at , such as .

§ Eponymous categories
§ Non-diffusing subcategories
While it should typically be clear from the name of an existing category which pages it should contain, the text of the category page may sometimes provide additional information on potential category contents. One way to determine if suitable categories already exist for a particular page is to check the categories of pages concerning similar or related topics. Another way is to search existing category names as described (top of page). Since all categories form part of a hierarchy, do not add categories to pages as if they are .

Wikipedia:Overcategorization
Apart from certain exceptions (i.e. and – see below), an article should be categorised under the branch in the category tree possible, without duplication in parent categories above it. In other words, articles should rarely be placed in both a given category and any of its sub- or parent (super-) categories. For example, the article "Paris" need only be placed in "Category:Cities in France", in both "" and "". Because the first category (cities) is in the second category (populated places), readers are already given the information that Paris is a populated place in France by it being a city in France.

Categorizations appear on article pages without annotations or referencing to justify or explain their addition; editors should be conscious of the need to maintain a neutral point of view when creating categories or adding them to articles. Categorizations should generally be uncontroversial; if the category's topic is likely to spark controversy, then a list article (which can be annotated and referenced) is probably more appropriate. For example, a politician (not convicted of any crime) should not be added to a category of notable criminals.

Articles with an eponymous category may be categorized in the broader categories that would be present if there were no eponymous category (e.g. the article appears in both and , even though the latter category is the parent of the former category). Editors should decide by consensus which solution makes most sense for a category tree. There are three options:

Keep both the eponymous category and the main article in the parent category. This is used in to allow that region's country articles to be navigated together.

It is usually desirable that pages using a template are not placed in the same categories as the template itself. To avoid this, the category for the template should be placed on the template's documentation page, normally within a block; if there is no documentation page, the category for the template may be placed on the template itself, within a block. Where a block is the last item in the template code, there should be no spaces or newlines between the last part of the template proper and the opening tag.

templates
placing the pages containing those templates into specific categories
However, it is recommended that articles not be placed in ordinary categories using templates in this way. There are many reasons for this: editors cannot see the category in the wikitext; removing or restructuring the category is made more difficult (partly because automated processes will not work); inappropriate articles and non-article pages may get added to the category; may be unavailable to be customised per category; and ordering of categories on the page is less controllable.

When templates are used to populate administration categories, ensure that the code cannot generate nonsensical or non-existent categories, particularly when the category name depends on a parameter. Also, see for ways of keeping inappropriate pages out of template-generated categories.

Sort keys
Sorting category pages
Categories of people are usually sorted by last name rather than first name, so "surname, forename" sort keys are used (as in "Washington, George"). There are many other rules for sorting people's names; for more information, see .
WP:NAMESORT
Other sort key considerations (in no particular order):

In English Wikipedia, sort order merges (ignores) case and diacritics. For example, "Baé", "Båf", "BaG" would be sorted in that order.

[2]
The main article/s of a category, if existent, should get sorted with a space as key so that it/they appear at the very top of the category. Example: Those articles are typically homonymous or at least synonymous to their category. Furthermore, other general articles that are highly relevant to the category should be sorted with an asterisk as key so that they also appear at the top of a category but beneath the main article/s. Example: Those articles are typically called "History of example", "Types of example", "List of example" or similar.
[[Category:Example| ]]
[[Category:Example|*]]
—a, an, and the—are among the most common reasons for using sort keys, which are used to transfer the leading article to the end of the key, as in {{DEFAULTSORT:Lady, The}}. Please also apply these sort keys to deliberate misspellings of these words, "da" or "tha" for "the", as well as foreign language leading articles, such as "el" or "der" (but beware of non-article words that have the same spelling, e.g. that translate as "at" or "one"). However, leading articles in foreign-language-derived names which are no longer translated in English are not subject to this rule; e.g. the sort key for should be left as the default value (i.e. no {{DEFAULTSORT}} required).
Leading articles
e.g.
El Paso
Landforms (and similar) that have noun prefixes such as should have the noun sorted after as {{DEFAULTSORT:Mull, Isle of}}. However, this isn't usually done for settlements and administrative divisions; for example, while uses {{DEFAULTSORT:Wight, Isle of}}, the categories for the county/district are sorted "Isle of Wight". Also for settlements such as the prefix isn't moved.
Isle of Mull
Isle of Wight
Isle of Wight, Virginia
Spell out abbreviations and characters used in place of words so that they can be found easily in categories. For example, the sort key for should be {{DEFAULTSORT:Mister Bean}} and should be sorted {{DEFAULTSORT:Dungeons And Dragons}}. An exception is the times sign (×) as in "Men's 4 × 100 metre" relay; use the letter x in this case.
Mr. Bean
Dungeons & Dragons
Hyphens, apostrophes and periods/full stops are the only punctuation marks that should be kept in sort values. The only exception is the apostrophe in names beginning with , which should be removed. For example, is sorted {{DEFAULTSORT:Oneill, Eugene}}. All other punctuation marks should be removed. (Commas can be added when re-ordering words, as in the previous example.)
O

Eugene O'Neill
Entries containing numbers sometimes need special sort keys to ensure proper numerical ordering. For example, IX comes before V in alphabetical order, so might have a sort key "John 9". To get the correct sort order zero padding may be required, thus the sort key for is "John 09" this ensures that sorts before – if we ever get to the hundredth Pope John, we would need to use three digits "John 009". Also note that numbers which include separators (such as commas or periods) will only have the part of the number before the first separator considered by the sorting algorithm. So might have a sort key "10000 Maniacs". It is important to stick to the same system for all similar entries in a given category.
Pope John IX
actual
Pope John IX
Pope John X
10,000 Maniacs
Systematic sort keys are also used in other categories where the logical sort order is not alphabetical (for example, individual month articles in year categories such as use sort keys like "*2004-04" for April). Again, such systems must be used consistently within a category.
Category:2004
In some categories, sort keys are used to exclude prefixes that are common to all or many of the entries, or are considered unimportant (such as "List of" or "The"). For example, in the page would have the sort key "Film", and in the page would have the sort key "Federal Budget".
Category:2004
2004 in film
Category:2004 in Canada
2004 Canadian federal budget
Use other sort keys beginning with a space (or an asterisk or a plus sign) for any "List of ..." and other pages that should appear the key article and the main alphabetical listings, including "Outline of" and "Index of" pages. The same technique is sometimes used to bring particular subcategories to the start of the list.

Similar to the handling of Latin letters, if the sort key is or begins with a lower case Greek letter, then the capital Greek letter will be displayed in headings on category pages. Items whose sort keys begin with lowercase letters will appear beneath corresponding capital letters. Several of these resemble Latin letters B, I, P etc., but they will sort after .
Z
: Not all of these types are suitable for inclusion in . For one-type categories, such as , Greek letter grouping is not useful.

If a page is to be given the same sort key in all or several of its categories, the should be used. Per , this is placed just before the list of category declarations. Default sort keys are sometimes defined even where they do not seem necessary—when they are the same as the page name, for example—in order to prevent other editors or automated tools from trying to infer a different default.

Category tree organization






Partial view of Wikipedia's category system from 2007. Arrows point from category to sub-category.


Categories are organized as overlapping "", formed by creating links between inter-related categories (in mathematics or computer science this structure is called a ). Any category may contain (or "branch into") , and it is possible for a category to be a subcategory of more than one "parent" category. (A is said to be a of B when B is a subcategory of A.)

parent category

[3]
There is one top-level category, . All other categories are found below this. Hence every category apart from this top one must be a subcategory of at least one other category.

There are two main kinds of category:

Topic categories

are named after a class (usually in the plural). For example, contains articles whose subjects are cities in France. A category may be explicitly labeled as such using the {{}} template.
Set categories
Category:Cities in France
Set category
Sometimes, for convenience, the two types can be combined, to create a category (such as , which contains articles about particular voivodeships as well as articles relating to voivodeships in general).

Items may belong to more than one category, but normally not to a category and its parent (there are, however, exceptions to this rule, such as ). An item may belong to several subcategories of a parent category (as pictured).


non-diffusing categories
If logical membership of one category implies logical membership of a second (an relationship), then the first category should be made a subcategory (directly or indirectly) of the second. For example, is a subcategory of , which in turn is a subcategory of .
is-a
Cities in France
Populated places in France
Geography of France
Many subcategories have two or more parent categories. For example, should be in both and . When making one category a subcategory of another, ensure that the members of the subcategory really can be expected (with possibly a few exceptions) to belong to the parent also. Category chains formed by parent–child relationships should never form closed loops; that is, no category should be contained as a subcategory of one of its own subcategories. If two categories are closely related but are not in a subset relation, then links between them can be included in the text of the category pages.

Wikipedia:Diffusing conflict
Although there is no limit on the size of categories, a large category will often be broken down ("diffused") into smaller, more specific subcategories. For example, is broken down by country into the subcategories , , etc.
Category:Rivers of Europe
Rivers of Albania
Rivers of Andorra
A category may be diffused using several coexisting schemes; for example, is broken down by artist, by date, by genre etc. may be created as ways of organizing schemes of subcategories. For example, the subcategories called " albums" are not placed directly into , but into the metacategory , which itself appears in Category:Albums. (See )

Category:Albums
Metacategories
Artistname
Category:Albums
Category:Albums by artist
Category:Categories by parameter
It is possible for a category to be only partially diffused—some members are placed in subcategories, while others remain in the main category.
Information about how a category is diffused may be given on the category page. Categories which are intended to be fully broken down into subcategories can be marked with the {{}} template, which indicates that any pages which editors might add to the main category should be moved to the appropriate subcategories when sufficient information is available. (If the proper subcategory for an article does not exist yet, either create the subcategory or leave the article in the parent category for the time being.)
category diffuse
To suggest that a category is so large that it ought to be diffused into subcategories, you can add the {{}} template to the category page.

Not all subcategories serve the "diffusion" function described above; some are simply subsets which have some special characteristic of interest, such as as a subcategory of or as a subcategory of . These are called . They provide an exception to the general rule that pages are not placed in both a category and its subcategory: there is no need to take pages out of the parent category because of their membership of a non-diffusing subcategory. (Of course, if the pages also belong to other subcategories that do cause diffusion, then they will not appear in the parent category directly.)

Non-diffusing subcategories should be identified with a template on the category page:

The {{}} templates should be used for sub-categories that are non-diffusing, like .
Non-diffusing subcategory
Category:American novelists of Asian descent
The {{}} can be used for categories where all child articles of a certain type are in the parent, like or .
All included
Category:Presidents of the United States
Category:Mountains of Switzerland
Subcategories defined by gender, ethnicity, religion, and sexuality should almost always be non-diffusing subcategories. The categorization guideline outlines the rules on these categories in more detail.
Wikipedia:Categorization/Ethnicity, gender, religion and sexuality
Note that some categories can be non-diffusing on some parents, and diffusing on others. For example, is a non-diffusing sub-category of , but it is a diffusing subcategory of .
