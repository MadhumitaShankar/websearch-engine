Indians abducted from Ethiopian cement factory freed



Haimanot Ashenafi
BBC Amharic


Kidnappers in Ethiopia have released six Indian nationals taken hostage for ransom.
They were being held in a small town 30 miles (48km) from the capital, Addis Ababa, in the Oromia region.
In early March, a total of 27 people were abducted from the mining site of a cement factory.
Eighteen of them were freed by the kidnappers on 10 March, local media reported.
The armed men had demanded a ransom of £370,000 ($480,000) for the release of the Indians and their three translators.
It is not clear if any money has now been paid for their release.
Girma Wayessa, a local administrator of the area, told the BBC the men had been freed, without giving details.
He said he was working with the community and security forces to combat the growing number of kidnappings in the area.
The government often associates these attacks with the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA), an armed rebel group. However, the OLA deny carrying out such operations.
