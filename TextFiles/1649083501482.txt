Our Ethos

SEFF is clear that in the context of ‘The Northern Ireland Troubles’ that there was no justification for terrorism and/or other criminal violence irrespective of who carried it out – criminal violence was wrong and unjustified.

Our group’s focus is upon the innocent and we make no distinction on the basis of someone’s religious or ethnic background …. Innocent Victims Uniting.
