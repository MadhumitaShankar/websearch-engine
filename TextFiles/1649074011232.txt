Review of IIT Madras - Indian Institute of Technology.

Placements:
Placements in our branch are pretty good when compared to other branches. The average salary package offered is 18 LPa. Almost everyone gets placed here.

In the electrical engineering course, apart from non-core companies, about 15-20 core companies visit our college for placements.

Infrastructure:
Wi-Fi facility is available almost all the time. I never faced a problem here. Our college provides facilities like a mess, library and hostel....

It is one of the best parts of my life, which I would cherish for a lifetime.

Placements:
More than 90% of the students from our course got placed. Remaining students either opted for higher studies or chose other careers like civil services, etc. Most of the companies are open for B.Tech and dual degree both in core and non-core areas. Those companies are JSW, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, American Express, Urban Ladder, etc.

Infrastructure:
In terms of infrastructure, IIT Madras provides you with state of the art equipment and lab facilities to work. These are easily accessible to students round the clock to aid their research works. Hostels are decent with all the necessary facilities. The quality of the food served in the mess is decent with strict hygienic norms, but the taste is not great. However, nutrition standards are checked by authorities. A huge range of sports facilities ranging from gymkhana to tennis court are well ma...
