Behind the IWD Doodle


Advancing equity with AI

Empowering women through
representation




The 2022 International Women’s Day (IWD) Doodle transports us around the world and gives us a glimpse of women’s everyday lives across different cultures. The common thread in all seven illustrations is how women show up for themselves, their families, and their communities.
















“We all wake up in the morning and have a purpose, big or small. It all matters.”




Thoka Maer, she/her, Art Director, Google Doodles team























Thoka Maer is the East Germany-born, US-based Doodler behind the global Doodle. With many women still navigating the challenges of the pandemic, her desire is for all women “to be able to choose the lives they want to live, and receive the respect they deserve.” She hopes that by seeing others like themselves represented on Google’s homepage, women everywhere feel recognized and inspired.

Accelerating across science, health, and media with AI
equity for women
















Googlers are committed to exploring how artificial intelligence (AI) can accelerate the ways gender inequities are tackled across industries. From recognizing female leaders lost in historical scientific archives, to improving women patient outcomes, to identifying gender disparities on screen — this is only the beginning. The potential of what AI can achieve is promising, spanning many more sectors and other identities beyond gender.
















Uncovering women in science with new machine-learning tools




The history of women in science tells a part of the ongoing story about the inequities that women face in the workplace. To uncover women-led contributions throughout time, Google Arts & Culture is collaborating with the Smithsonian Institution to mine its over 170-year-old archives.

Improving breast cancer detection using AI




Diagnosing breast cancer accurately and early with mammograms remains a challenge. This sparked in exploring how AI can be used to reduce the time to diagnosis. As a next step, Google Health is partnering with Imperial College London and the U.K. National Health Service to explore the benefits AI can bring to screening specialists and patients in a clinical setting.

Using AI to identify gender gaps on screen




In collaboration with the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, the Google Media Understanding for Social Exploration (MUSE) team has been using machine learning to analyze media content. Years of data shows hard evidence of the gender gap in media representation.




In , the first study measured gender representation in top box office movies, analyzing a 90-minute film in as little as 15 minutes. A subsequent study measured representation in global YouTube ads. Both revealed that men are seen more on camera but that films and ads with female-led or gender-balanced content get more views. A analysis of Super Bowl ads further reinforced these findings.

2020




Looking ahead, the team is working to partner with researchers and AI ethicists to build better machine learning models that can scan video, images, audio, and text and identify even more identity traits — like ability, skin tone, and body type. The data-driven insights uncovered will continue not only to inform Google's work, but also to help marketers and the film industry improve representation and portrayals of women.


























“As a mom, a woman of color, a person in tech, a STEM author, and an immigrant, I’m inspired by the possibilities Responsible AI can unlock. This nascent field has a unique opportunity to create equitable outcomes across many social scenarios.”
