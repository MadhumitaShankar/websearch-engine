Why does BBC iPlayer think I'm outside the UK?

What can I do to help with buffering or playback problems?




Buffering is caused by the internet connection between your router and your device cutting off and joining again, so to play a programme smoothly and without interruption, you’ll need a good internet connection.
If your internet connection isn’t fast enough, the programme may buffer, or you’ll see a message saying you have ‘insufficient bandwidth’ (bandwidth is the amount of data your connection can transfer).
What can I do to improve playback?


If other devices are sharing the same internet connection, try disconnecting them, or just turn them off to see if that makes a difference.
Disconnect other devices



Try switching to Standard Definition as High Definition programmes will require more bandwidth and may cause buffering if your internet connection isn't strong enough. Check the following pages for advice on changing the video quality on BBC iPlayer: BBC iPlayer on mobiles and tablets will automatically adjust the video quality according to your internet connection at that time.
Switch to Standard Definition (SD)

How do I set the video quality on my connected TV or games console?



If you’re connecting via WiFi, try a wired connection to help rule out interference from another WiFi network. Or you could try moving your device closer to your internet router.
Try a wired internet connection



If you’re using BBC iPlayer with a browser on your computer, mobile or tablet, try using another browser to see if that helps. And if you have lots of tabs open in your browser, close them down as they could be affecting the device's performance.
Try a different browser
