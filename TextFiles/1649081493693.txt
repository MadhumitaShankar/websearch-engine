BBC News, NATO Summit, 24 March 2022










28 March 2022

Summary of complaint

We received some complaints about Sarah Smith's reports on the NATO Summit, from viewers who felt a clip showing leaders preparing for a photograph was misleading and biased against Prime Minister Boris Johnson.


Our response

Sarah Smith’s reports on the NATO Summit covered the main developments of the day, showing footage of both Prime Minister Boris Johnson and President Joe Biden’s speeches and reflecting decisions made by the alliance. We don’t believe that Sarah’s reports gave a misleading view of the events of that day. While the leaders gathering for a photograph was one of several short clips shown of the Summit, we strongly reject any claims that the footage was doctored or misleadingly edited.
