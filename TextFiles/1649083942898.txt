With just six designers left, the competition is hotting up. Arriving at Michelle’s Brighton studio, the designers discover their next challenge. They are off to the cathedral city of Salisbury to transform three very different shops.
Working in pairs, they must give three retail businesses a new lease of life. But before they hit the high street, they must first meet their clients and take it in turns to pitch their design ideas. The three businesses are a bridal shop, a homeware shop and a lingerie shop – and one contestant isn’t happy with the business they’ve been assigned to! One designer from each pairing will be chosen to lead on the overall design, so whoever loses the pitch will have to act as an assistant to their teammate.
Helping Michelle decide who should stay or go this week is the queen of shops herself, Mary Portas. Known for her straight-talking and no-nonsense approach, she knows what makes shoppers hit the high street rather than shop online. There’s success for one team who nailed the brief, but the other two teams must face Michelle and Mary to justify their design decisions. One more designer will be eliminated, leaving five left to fight another day.
