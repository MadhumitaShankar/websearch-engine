Sandbox
The main namespace is the default namespace and does not use a prefix in article page names. This is distinct from other namespaces, where page names are always prefixed by an indicator of the particular namespace in which the page resides. For example, all are prefixed by , their by by and various types of internal administrative pages by (such as this page). Thus, any page created such a prefix will automatically be placed in the article namespace.
