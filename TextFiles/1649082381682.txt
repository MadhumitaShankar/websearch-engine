The icon to select subtitles is a which you'll see on the playback screen. On the website and TV app, you can choose the size of the subtitles to suit your needs. We’re planning to bring this feature to the BBC iPlayer mobile/tablet apps in the future, but can’t confirm when that would be.

Are subtitles available on live channels?

Subtitles are available on our live TV channel streams on the BBC iPlayer website and on our TV app. This is a trial which is available on all channels apart from BBC Parliament, BBC Alba and S4C. We hope to roll out this functionality to the BBC iPlayer mobile/tablet app in the future.
Whilst we try to make subtitles available on as many browsers and operating systems as possible, there are times when this isn't possible, particularly on older devices.
