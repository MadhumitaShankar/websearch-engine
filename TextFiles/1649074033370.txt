Yes it's the best thing you can do! Before you invest in opening your own centre make sure you have made a mark for yourself among the local people of the area where you are planning to open. My experience says good networking with other people of the field as well as with people related to the field (from orthopedics to technicians )is essential to start your own clinic. 5 years is a long time so I would advise you to go ahead take the plunge! Rest assured if you're honest with your work and good in it you will never regret opening a clinic, instead you will expand it into a hospital too! Along with physiotherapy if you also inculcate a fitness studio (initially just with treadmill, static cycle and ball exercises ) or weight loss programmes you will be more at benefit. Good luck!
