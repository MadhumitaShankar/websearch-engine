Review of IIM, Indore - Indian Institute of Management.

Placements:
Placements in our college are great, with the average package for the combined PGP-IPM batch being around 18 LPA. Various companies, both national and international, visit the campus to offer placements. The roles offered are mostly senior-level managerial or consulting roles. Internships along with PPOs are also offered by the same companies. Nearly 250 companies visited the campus this year, and the placement number is expected to cross 300. Placements were 100% in both internships and final p...

IPM in IIM Indore offers the best course which you haven't heard.

Placements:
Almost 100% of the students from our course got placements. The highest salary package offered maybe around 40 LPA, and the lowest salary package offered was 8 LPA. Recruiting companies for our college ranges from Google to small startups. I will give 4 stars out of 5 stars because placements are affected due to COVID-19 pandemic.

Infrastructure:
Hostels are nice here, but there are no air-conditioners. However, they allow coolers, and the speed of the Wi-Fi facility is very fast. The library is good, and the cl...

IPM is going to be the most popular course in India very soon.

Placements:
Placements for the batch 2017-2019 are still going on, but we have the data about the batch 2016-2018. The average salary package offered last year was about 15 LPA for IPM students and 18 LPA for PGP students. However, IIM bill has been passed this year, and the placement stats are expected to improve a lot. We expect the salary packages offered to be around 20 LPA in the coming years and overtake the average salary package offered to PGP students. Companies such as IBM, Google, BCG, DBS, HSBC,...

Review of Indian Institute of Management, Indore.

Placements:
I am in the first year of my course, but I have some information about the placement records of the previous year. The placements of the final year students were good, and it's been the same since 2015 for IPM students. The highest domestic salary package offered was more than 31 LPA, and the highest salary package offered for international jobs was above 60 LPA. Many companies like ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and KPMG, etc., have visited our campus and recruited all students. Similar was the case in ...

IPM is the only undergraduate program offered by IIM.

Placements:
I don't know the lowest and highest packages offered, but I know the average package offered to IPM students which was around 15 lacs per annum in final placements, while the package offered to PGP students was around 19 lacs per annum. Overall, the packages are great. Summer internships for the fourth year students and social internships for the second year students are known to be good as I heard from my seniors. It reflects the work and efficiency of the placement cell.

How is I. M Indore?

Placements:
Talking about the placement here is also best with an average placement offer around 17 to 8 LPA and the highest is around 25-35 LPA, there is no doubt about the quality of students. What is more important is what the institute has in store for you while you are here spending 2 years of your precious life. Around 100% students get placed as you can see its not and ordinary college.

Infrastructure:
The campus of this college is mind blowing and the campus size is around 193 acres, so big with lush green campus wi...

IIM, Indore is great for undergraduate IPM as well.

Placements:
Placements for our senior batch in the college were great as they received nearly Rs. 16 LPA as average salary package. The college has achieved 100% placements record. Many different companies are now recruiting the students of IPM course. Hence, almost all kinds of business roles are offered to IPM students during the placement drives. The summer internships for our seniors were also great this year, as they were offered the highest stipend of Rs. 4 lacs.

All things in our college are best, so the college is popular.

Placements:
The percentage of students who get placed is very high from this course. Placements are also very good here, and the course is also very important. Internship opportunities for students are very good because all the students are good in nature and behaviour.

Infrastructure:
Facilities are very good here, but there are also some problems with Wi-Fi, and there will be noise in the library. However, all students always study hard. Medical and games facilities are also good. The food served in the canteen is of good...

If you want to change your life to be better, then join IPM.

Placements:
Placements for the IPM programme are slowly but surely inching up with the average salary package being 15 LPA this year. However, since the IIM bill has been passed and the change of curriculum along with the addition of a foreign exchange programme as well, it is expected to go up significantly. The highest domestic salary package offered was around 30 LPA, and the highest international salary package offered was 64 LPA. Companies such as Wipro, Google, PwC, DBS, BCG, Goldman Sachs, Bank of Am...

IPM course at IIM Indore is good.

Placements:
Placements in IIM are very good even for the IPM course, and that was one of the main reasons why I chose this course. As per records, the highest package offered last year was more than 60 lacs per annum, and the stipend offered during summer internships was around 4 lacs. Moreover, reputed companies visited our campus and recruited students in huge numbers and offered many major managerial roles.

The infrastructure is world class not only in terms of quality but also quantity. For example, the ...

It offers one of the most challenging undergraduate opportunities in the country.

The batch of 2013 to 2018 witnessed the best placements ever for the IPM course. The average salary package offered was 12 LPA. For the students of the first batch, i.e. 2011-2016, the average salary package offered was 15 LPA. Placement trend for the IPM programme is expected to be improved further with the implementation of the IIM bill. There were 100% placements for the combined PGP-IPM batch, which was around 600 students. Due to such a large number of participants, the placement process to...

The college offers a nice campus life and great opportunities for management aspirants.

Placements:
Placements for the 2018-2020 batch are still going on. Due to such a huge batch size, the placements stretch over a couple of months, and it takes time for the final statistics to come out. But as far as we have found out, placements have been better than last year with the average salary package expected to rise from 18 LPA (offered last year) to around 20 LPA for the entire batch. Also, this year the highest domestic package till now has been bagged by an IPM participant, showing good times ah...

Life at IIM Indore is an unforgettable journey.

Placements:
Placements for the IPM batch are conducted along with those of the PGPs. We compete for the same jobs as there is no distinction between offers for IPM and PGP courses. The highest salary package offered according to previous year data was around 33 LPA (domestically) and 64 LPA (internationally). Most of the students choose courses of finance or consulting as their specialisation. But the marketing branch has the most number of students and witnesses the most offers. Heavyweight companies such ...

IPM is the uniqueness of IIM Indore.

Placements:
Though I don't know in-depth about placements, I have heard from seniors that the packages offered to students are great, like 18 lacs per annum. But, the best thing about placements is that all the students get placed and it was one of the main reasons for me choosing this college. Moreover, managerial roles are offered by companies. The college provides opportunities for the students to participate in industry projects which is a great bonus. Summer internships provided are also great, and the...
