A BBC iPlayer for everyone


Accessible programmes in iPlayer
We want iPlayer to be accessible to as many people as possible, whatever their needs, however they’re watching.
That’s why we offer accessible versions of many programmes, including Audio Described (AD), Sign Language (SL) and Subtitle (speech bubble) options.






How to find accessible versions of programmes
Audio Described and Sign Language versions


You’ll find full lists of Audio Described and Sign Language programmes via the Categories menu.


You can also search for a programme and choose the version you want (if it’s available) from the playback page.








If you’re using the website version of iPlayer, we’ll also show you a message telling you when you’re on an accessible version of a programme.






How to turn on Subtitles
Subtitles should be available on any programme you watch on demand. To turn them on, simply hit the subtitle icon (which looks like a speech bubble) at the bottom right corner of the playback screen once you've started playing the programme.






Why can’t I find the version I want?


Accessible versions of programmes (with Audio Description and Sign Language) often appear on iPlayer after the non-accessible versions. This is because they’re generally shown on TV after the non-accessible version.

This means accessible versions are often still available after the non-accessible version has expired.
