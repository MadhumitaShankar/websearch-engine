The vibrant photos of Brooklyn-based photographer Jamel Shabazz capture life underground on the New York City subway in the 1980s.
Shabazz's work aims at showcasing positive portraits of the African-American community during a time of high crime, drugs and violence. "I had to work with great zeal to get out there and use my camera as a weapon to combat a lot of that negativity," he says in this video, which reveals the joy found in communication and connection – a vivid reminder of life before Covid.
