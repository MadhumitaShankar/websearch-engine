To sum it up, a part-time MBA/PGDM will be advantageous in the long run. Applicability of a part-time MBA/PGDM is much more than a full-time since you have the opportunity to apply your theoretical knowledge at your workplace and can notice the practical application in a short period. Also, you get to learn at your pace, without disturbing your fixed schedule. Part-time MBA/PGDM courses are becoming increasingly popular since now people understand the significance of these courses and with ease, they could be completed.
FAQs Regarding Part-Time MBA

Q: For whom is the Part-time MBA best suited?
A: Part-time MBA is best suited for working professionals who cannot afford to invest the requisite time and funds required for the full-time Executive MBA. This allows them to attend evening or weekend classes, which would let the students continue with their jobs alongside upgrading their skillsets and adding an 'MBA' tag to their profiles.

Q: How is a Part-time MBA better in comparison to the full-time MBA/Executive MBA or Distance MBA programs?
A: While a full-time program would require 100% involvement and most of the programs and residential ones. On the other hand, Distance MBA programs are offered in an online mode wherein direct communication with the faculty members or fellow students. The Part-Time MBA module takes care of both these aspects. Not only is the program more affordable, but it also allows one to imbibe the learnings in a classroom environment which is offered in a pedagogy that is a mix of traditional and modern methods. This mode also enables students to interact with the professors, guest lecturers from industries and fellow students during or after the classes.

Q: What is the duration of a Part-time MBA?
A: The duration of a Part-time MBA is flexible. Students can complete the programme as per their convenience and capabilities within three to five years. Each institute has its specific duration and some of them also allow students to take an extension to complete the program. This is the flexibility offered by the institutes to the Part-time MBA students since they are pursuing the program while continuing with their jobs.

Q: Is the curriculum of a Part-time MBA as rigorous as a full-time MBA?
A: As compared to the full-time Executive MBA program, the rigour is much lesser in a Part-time MBA. The curriculum or the course design is much more flexible to give the students give the breather to efficiently balance their jobs as well as studies. Since the classes are conducted in the evenings or weekends, students can prepare their schedule to study or complete assignments without hampering their professional responsibilities.

Q: Shall I opt for a specialised Part-time MBA or a generic one?
A: This is a decision that a student should take based on his/her career aspiration or goal. If s/he aims to work in a particular sector, then it is best to choose a suitable specialisation. On the other hand, if the student wants to excel in the present job and get the management lessons on each function to prep up for a leadership role, then a general Part-time MBA would suffice. Moreover, there are several electives to opt for in a general Part-time MBA program as well, which a student can choose based on his/her interest areas.

Q: Is there an age limit for the students interested in pursuing a Part-time MBA program?
A: Although there is no hard and fast criterion for age limit, some of the institutes do have an age limit criteria, which ranges from 27 years to 50 years.

Q: What kind of industry exposure can a student expect from Part-time MBA courses?
A: Owing to the course design, there is no scope of industry training or visits. Moreover, since the students are working professionals, they are already aware of the major functions and operations involved in an organisation. However, the B-schools do arrange guest lectures from industry experts to provide fresh insights on the best management practices and trends. Moreover, there is ample scope of peer learning from fellow students who come from diverse backgrounds in terms of sectors and functions.

Q: Are placement processes conducted after the completion of the program?
A: No, the placement process is not conducted by the institutes after the program completion. Since the program is attended by working professionals, who want to take their career at the next level, placement support is not provided by the institutes.

Q: Since there is no placement offered by the institutes, what are the scopes for a student after completing the program?
A: The scope lies in taking a leap in the existing career or job. If the employee wants to get promoted to a higher managerial post, a Part-time MBA would provide him/her a much-needed push to climb up the corporate ladder. In case he/she wants to change the career path or explore a more challenging leadership role in a different industry type or organisation in the same sector, the Part-time MBA would be the roadmap to the new avenue, without having to take a break from the job and suspending the earning. Some may also like to venture into entrepreneurship after the course completion.

Q: Is a Part-time MBA considered relevant by the industry?
A: Yes, there is equal acceptance of the Part-time MBA holders as there is for the full-time MBA or Executive MBAs. Moreover, if pursued from one of the top B-schools, the Part-time MBA is aptly valued by the industry. The prior work experience is also considered. Rather than the degree, the companies tend to look at the skillsets, leadership qualities and ability to control a crisis or turn challenges into opportunities of the existing or prospective employees. If one is equipped with these qualities, there would be no hindrance towards reaching his/her goal.

Q: Are the Part-time MBA programs residential in nature?
A: Since the programs are conducted during evenings or weekends, and the students attend jobs during the day, the scope of Part-time MBA programs being residential is not there. Students visit the campus to attend the classes as per the schedule and need not stay back longer. In case, they need to stay back after class hours for assignments or exams, they may utilise common spaces like the library, reading room, computer labs or cafeteria.

Greetings Mathew, Selection of the course for your higher studies, solely depends upon your interest level. For the choice of college, according to me, NMIMS will be a better option.

SIBM is a slightly better bet than NMIMS, majorly because of smaller batch size which does have an important impact, and the slightly lesser fee at SIBM Pune. However, final call between NMIMS and SIBM should be based on the specialisation you are interested in.

Number of seats: almost same Even Academics wise, RIIM provides quality education and also balances the corporate exposure with academics. Which helps the students during placements. Also no college in Pune provides you extra certifications which RIIM Pune does. So in comparison I would suggest RIIM Pune for your PG course.

A BBA combined with an MBA would be a fantastic professional choice. It would be a wise decision to choose LPU because, in the current situation, this is the university that caters to the all-round growth of its students and nourishes them with care to propel their careers to a pinnacle of ultimate achievement that many would envy. I believe that taking an integrated course at LPU not only saves a year but is also financially feasible. In terms of curriculum, exposures, and placements, LPU, in my opinion, has an advantage. The following are some of the significant highlights of this LPU course: The Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs (ACBSP) of the United States has granted the School of Business accreditation for its Management, Commerce, and Economics programmes. In the coveted NIRF 2021 ranking given by The Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), Government of India, the school is placed No. 2 in India in Outreach and Inclusivity and 38th overall. Diversity: The school has students from all 50 states as well as more than 500 international students. Students have worked with organisations such as Himalaya Wellness, Bonn Biscuits, Sony, Colgate, Modern Food, Capgemini, Oyo Rooms, Decathlon, Big Bazaar, Godrej, Lyoness, EduIsFun, Republic Motors, Facebook, Sitaby, Cloud Buy, Training Wizards, Design Lounge, and others on their Live Projects. Students can earn money while learning by participating in business projects.

JAGSoM formerly known as IFIM Business school. Well the college and student is what help each other. IFIM definetly has a brand image that will help you in your placements, amazing faculty and infrastructure. It will do EVERYTHING to make you job ready and help you get placed. But then if you are not a able candidate you may not get placed. So it's again 50 / 50. More and more students are interested in IFIM so now college has become little choosy on whom they admit. It has a good interview process. Over all college is brilliant. !

Some institutes accept other competitive exam scores like that of XAT, MAT, GMAT, NMAT and SNAP etc. However, if any student opts for direct entry, they are expected to obey the unique selection process of the institute. In the first place, the applicant must register either on the College website (online) or by visiting the College campus (offline) and apply for entry. Second, they must apply the papers for which they are chosen on the basis of their marks in their board of directors assessments and graduation. An applicant with an outstanding performance and good communication has a better chance of being chosen for entry.
