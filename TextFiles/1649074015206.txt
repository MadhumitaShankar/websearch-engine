Hi, First of all, don't worry about it, By experience, I want to share a top-secret with you JEE is not the exam that judges your academics, It judges you more on the basis of how you handle pressure and Engineering is also the field of how you handle pressure, during Engineering, they teach you a lot about pressure handling and thus companies need engineering so that they have people who can handle pressures and complete the work within the pressure at a much faster rate. So, Just Prepare yourself well and just make yourself less stressed and maintain good consistency.

Are JEE Main and JEE Advance different exams?

Hi Payal, JEE Main And JEE Advanced are two different exams. If you want to take admission in IIT, then first you have to qualify JEE Main and then qualify JEE Advanced. By qualifying JEE Main you can get admission in NITs and other GFTIs colleges. JEE Advanced is tougher as compared to JEE Main.

Hii Payal, JEE Mains and JEE Advanced are the two different exams, but both are corelated, without qualification of JEE Mains you can't appear in JEE Advanced exam, you can attempt thrice after 12th, including the time you appeared in 12th for JEE Mains exam, but for JEE Advanced, you can attempt...

Hi Chinmay, Cracking JEE Main is not a big deal. You can easily crack this exam if you have done your Class 11-12th sincerely. You can opt for Coaching if you want to give edge to your JEE preparation. You can comment if you want more information regarding JEE preparation.

Hello Annie Sharma, these days absolute marks actually don't matter. What matters is percentile. But the best way would be to download the college predictor for JEE Mains. Then fill up different values of percentile and pronto you will come to know as to at what minimum percentile one can get CSE...
