The Misadventures of Romesh Ranganathan
Series 3







Romesh heads off on a journey to Romania. With the help of activist and media expert Angi Serban, he explores the many amazing things that are overlooked in this vast slice of eastern Europe.

As with most Brits, the headlines that flash into Romesh’s mind when he thinks about Romania are those around communism, the 90s orphan crisis, maligned Roma and its greatest celebrity export, Count Dracula. But is this image justified? Or does Romania have more to offer? Landing in Bucharest, the only place in the country he’s heard of, Romesh meets political activist and media expert Angi Serban at the parliament palace, the astonishing architectural behemoth built on the command of the communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
Failing to warn him about the miles they’re about to clock, she takes Rom out of the capital to explore many amazing things that are overlooked in this vast slice of eastern Europe.
Romesh and Angi embark on a journey through the country’s seemingly endless and varied landscapes. Along the way, they sample Romania’s ghoulish side, seeing Transylvania and Vlad the Impaler’s castle and paying their respects in a 'merry' cemetery. They also witness cars rolling up hills, drive along the spectacular yet dangerous Transfagarasan Highway, dance to world-famous Roma music and take part in a spiritual ceremony in Romania’s traditional heartland.
But whilst Romesh realises the beauty of Romania, he also learns how the hangover of the communist regime remains, what challenges are still faced today and why more people visiting would help the country to continue to move forward.
