As summer arrives, the farmers call on friends to help gather hundreds of sheep from the mountain slopes for shearing. Good dogs and good shepherds are vital to get the job done.

As summer arrives in Snowdonia, it’s time for the farmers to gather their sheep off the mountain slopes ready for shearing. With a lot of livestock to round up and much ground to cover, a team of good dogs and good shepherds is vital.
Ken and Lisa Markham leave their own farm behind to help Ken’s cousin Wil gather his sheep as they do every year - a favour that will be returned later in the season. It’s wild and rugged terrain, too steep for quad bikes, so the only way to round up the flock is on foot with a gang of sheepdogs.
Others are able to use technology like quad bikes to speed things up such as near Bala, where Geraint Davies is helping to gather sheep on a large estate. Near Ysbyty Ifan, young farmer Beca Glyn needs to round up a small gang of ewes who are being sent to Anglesey. Fortunately, she has the help of trusty sheepdog Bruce, cousin Elin and young dog Bess.
On Cadair Idris, the day of the Markhams big gather arrives. They have around 800 sheep to round up from across the steep slopes of one of Wales’s most impressive peaks. Ken and Lisa have called on plenty of helpers from the local community, including cousin Wil and their old friend Goronwy who has been gathering these slopes for longer than Ken’s been alive. Teamwork, experience, and top-quality sheepdogs pay off and a hard day’s work means a well-earned feast for the shepherds.
