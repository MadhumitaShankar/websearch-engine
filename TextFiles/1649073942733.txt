Electronics Engineering can be defined as the branch of engineering that utilises electrical components such as semiconductors, transistors, diodes and others to design Electronics circuits, devices, integrated circuits and electronic systems. The engineers typically also design passive electrical components, usually based on printed circuit boards. Electronics engineers also test circuits built using various electrical components such as resistors, capacitors, inductors etc. to achieve a particular functionality.
Electronics Engineering is considered a subfield of . Electronics Engineering subjects include Analog Electronics, Digital Electronics, Embedded Systems, Power Electronics, etc. An academic degree can be acquired from some universities by pursuing electronics engineering courses with a major in Electronics engineering, while other universities use Electrical Engineering as the subject. The term electrical engineer is still used in the academic world to include Electronics engineers.
Electrical Engineering
Differences between Electronics and Electrical Engineering
The fundamental difference between the two branches of engineering is as follows:




Aspects

Electrical Engineering

Electronics Engineering


Circuits

No Processing Capability

Have Processing Capability


Function

Circuits power machines with electricity

Circuits interpret an instruction or a signal


Component Structure

Electrical components are large and use AC voltages

Mostly, electronic components are tiny and work with a single microprocessor

Dear Aspirant, The following are the best institutes in India for M.Tech in the ECE degree programme: IIT Kanpur- Indian Institute of Technology. IIT Delhi- Indian Institute of Technology. MIT Manipal - Manipal Institute of Technology. COEP Pune - College of Engineering. LPU Phagwara- Lovely Professional University. VIT Vellore - Vellore Institute of Technology. SRM University Chennai - SRM Institute of Science and Technology. CU Mohali- Chandigarh University. UPES Dehradun- University of Petroleum and Energy Studies. My friends did M.Tech in ECE from LPU Phagwara, everyone is well settled and some of them got placed, some doing Ph.D. and a few moved abroad. LPU provides very good opportunities to all the students of the ECE department. There are some facts that you would also like about the School of Electronics and Electrical Engineering in LPU. Placements: LPU has a good placement record for ECE students. Every year more than 500+ companies including national and multinational companies visit LPU for placement. A few of them are BOSCH, Microsoft, Code Nation, Adobe, etc. In which students of ECE are placed. The average package offered for the M.Tech in ECE programme at LPU is Rs. 5 LPA. All faculty members are well qualified from IITs, NITs, and top-ranked universities all over the world. Labs/Workshops: Students who study ECE from LPU get an opportunity to do practical work in their field more than theoretical as LPU has Robotics and Automation lab, Bosch Lab, and other workshops conducted by this department such as Robotics workshop, Labview workshop, and many more. Specialisation Offered: Power Electronics, Power Systems, Renewable Energy, DSP, Robotics And Automation, VLSI, and many more which helps to do more research in their field. Research: All the faculty members are really helpful for all aspects whether it is academics or any other. Many students have published research papers and patents in International Journal and Conferences. Infrastructure: All the facilities are available on the campus itself, a student does not need to go outside for anything. On the campus, Central Library, Hospital facility is available 24*7 for staff and students, Shopping mall, Indoor Sports Stadium with 3 Olympic size Swimming Pools, Public/Private Sector Banks, ATM, etc. I hope this helps Good Luck!
