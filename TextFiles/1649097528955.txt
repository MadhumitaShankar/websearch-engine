How to use a Wikipedia shortcut


A Wikipedia shortcut can be entered into the Wikipedia search box to quickly bring you to a project page. For example, you can type or into the search box and then press the enter key (or click the magnifying glass icon), to get to the page, instead of having to type in the complete phrase.
WP:R
H:R
Wikipedia:Redirect
Alternatively, you can use a shortcut in the in your browser's address bar. For example, you are currently viewing the page. The URL for this page is . You could then get from here to the page by replacing with in the address bar, followed by pressing the enter key. (If your browser has relative URL entry, simply prefix the shortcut with instead of having to edit the existing URL.)

Readability







Shortcut



WP:SCJARGON
Shortcuts are often used on talk pages in their abbreviated form, decreasing for the general reader. For example, some editors are familiar with the bulk of the , recognizing what they stand for on sight. Others, however, are faced with pages full of incomprehensible jargon, the meaning of which is not immediately clear. Shortcuts also are sometimes (ab)used to make a , best described by .
readability
Wikipedia namespace shortcuts
WP:POINT
WP:WOTTA
To avoid these problems, a good practice when creating shortcuts is to choose common English words that are easily identifiable and memorable. Another good practice is to be mindful of the general reader and use meaningful terms when citing an obscure shortcut. For example, the gives readers an idea of the subject of the target page, while the bare abbreviation is unintelligible to those unfamiliar with the term.

It should also be remembered that shortcuts are a convenience, not a substitute for titles. Shortcuts should not appear in , or any other place where a page title is expected.

Shortcut



WP:LINKBOXES
Small link boxes, listing the names of the page's shortcuts, appear at the top of many pages, especially those on policies and guidelines. A shortcut link box can be added to a page, by placing the template (for ) or (for Help pages) at the top of the page's text, while editing. For template redirects, is used instead.

{{|WP:<x>}}
shortcut
project namespace

{{|H:<x>}}
shortcut

{{}}
Template shortcut
The point of these template boxes is not to list every single redirect for any given page (that's what is for). Instead, they generally should list only the most common and easily remembered redirects.
Special:WhatLinksHere
pages with shortcuts pointing to them typically use or the template, such as on this page, instead of the shortcut template . Another frequently used template is: .

To learn more about the different shortcut box templates and their functions, see documentation at {{}}. Among other things, there are templates for making boxes flow to the left and now, anchors are automatically added, making it much simpler to link to a page section.

Shortcut names







Shortcut



WP:SCNAMES
Shortcut names are almost always in uppercase.
A shortcut is typically named using the following convention:


PREFIX:SUFFIX
In the above form, the prefix is typically one of the prefixes in the following section, and the suffix is an or of the redirect target. However quite a lot are simply .
acronym
abbreviation
WP:BAD
If the target is a , the following conventions are common (where 'Y' is an additional sequence of uppercase characters or numerals):
sub-page


PREFIX:SUFFIX/Y



For example, is a shortcut to , which is a subpage of , which has a shortcut .
P:HVNY/DYK
Portal:Hudson Valley/Did you know
Portal:Hudson Valley
P:HVNY



is a shortcut to , which is a subpage of , which has a shortcut .
WP:ACC/P
Wikipedia:Request an account/Procedures
Wikipedia:Request an account
WP:ACC


PREFIX:SUFFIXY



For example, is a shortcut to , which is a subpage of , which has the shortcut .
WP:AFDLT
Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Log/Today
Wikipedia:Articles for deletion
WP:AFD
Shortcuts that do not follow the above naming convention are discouraged, and are typically deleted.
The directory of shortcuts contains several conflicts for prefixes of subpages, often caused by a shortcut being 're-targeted' (modified to point to a new target page) without the shortcuts to subpages also being re-targeted.



For example, was originally used for , and several shortcuts for subpages were created ( & ). After several years, 'WP:CJ' was updated to point to , but the subpage shortcuts have not changed.
WP:CJ
Wikipedia:Community Justice
WP:CJ/E
WP:CJ/M/1
Wikipedia:Centijimbos
Before creating a shortcut, use to ensure that the same prefix is not being used for different purposes. e.g. has several existing uses. No additional confusion would be caused by creating a shortcut WP:CJQ, however creating a shortcut WP:CJ/Q would be adding to the existing mess. There is a long-standing feature request to resolve shortcut subpages automatically. (See .)
Special:PrefixIndex
WP:CJ
T14980
Prefixes that shouldn't be used for other purposes include:

 naming conventions
WP:NC
 articles for deletion
WP:AFD
Other prefixes have become common for a set of pages include:

 notability
WP:N

One unique feature of the WP: alias is its utility in searching for vast number of project pages. This is because most project pages outside the Wikipedia namespace, will have a for the Wikipedia namespace prefix appended to their title and the same for most major shortcuts to them (e.g., Help:Watchlist, with the shortcut H:W, has redirects at and at . Thus, by extension, most project pages may be found by searching using the WP: alias alone, e.g. . For more, see .

Pseudo-namespaces


When the shortcut does not use one of the namespace aliases listed above (WP or WT), it is a and is case-sensitive.

However, when a prefix is used by multiple shortcuts, and has broad community support, it is referred to as a to distinguish these shortcuts from other cross-namespace redirects. (Note that the term "" is also used to refer to namespaces without content that are provided by the MediaWiki software and extensions, such as Special:, Media:, Feedback:)

How to create a shortcut



Note: The following is an example. The shortcut WP:TS already exists.
Say you want to create the shortcut to an existing page, . Create a new page, , and in it place the following:
WP:TS
Wikipedia:Template standardisation
Wikipedia:TS

{{R from shortcut}}

#REDIRECT [[Wikipedia:Template standardisation]]
The resulting shortcut will be .
WP:TS
If you're creating a shortcut to a , you need to insert an additional colon (":") at the beginning of the link, as in the following.
category

{{R from shortcut}}

#REDIRECT [[:Category:Redirects from shortcuts]]
The template must always be included in this kind of redirect. It records that the redirect is a shortcut, and auto-categorizes it into .
{{}}
R from shortcut
Category:Redirects from shortcuts


(See for more information on categories of redirects.)
Wikipedia:Template messages/Redirect pages
Many shortcuts are ; others are or single but memorable words from a longer page title.

Changing shortcuts







Shortcut



WP:CHANGESC
Technically that's easy. All it takes is to click on the shortcut wherever it is, then on the page it leads to (a shortcut is a redirect) click on the "redirected from" link near the top of the page (forcing in the URL when you go back to the shortcut page); edit the target ; then add if that template doesn't already appear.
&redirect=no
#REDIRECT [[Wikipedia:Whatever]]
{{}}
R from shortcut
However, before changing a shortcut, consider its existing usage:

If you wish to retarget a shortcut that's already in use, you should take into account how active its target page is. For example, if you just created a WikiProject, and want a specific shortcut for it, but the one you want is already in use by another project, it's generally recommended to post a message on that project's talk page asking the members if you may change the link, even if the project is tagged as .
{{|inactive}}
WikiProject status
Above all, check the shortcut backlinks with "what links here"; changing a shortcut used elsewhere can be highly disruptive. If you do change a shortcut under these circumstances, you should be sure to change it in the pages that linked to it as well, so that they link to the old target. If they were used in any , it is not a good idea then to change the redirect because these discussions cannot be edited.
closed deletion discussions
If it has no backlink, folks might still use it directly when searching. If you're not 100% sure that the old target is unused, ask about it on the shortcut's talk page.
For controversial cases, go to .
Wikipedia:Requests for comment
After changing a shortcut, there are other pages which may need to be updated:

If the shortcut is already listed on or a similar list like , please update that entry showing the new target page.
Wikipedia:List of shortcuts
Wikipedia:Shortcuts to talk pages
If the old target page mentions its shortcut, then that also should be updated, typically in or similar .

Limitations


Redirects (including shortcuts) to pages on other projects and won't workthis formerly supported feature was abused and hence it has been disabled. The software will display the redirect page instead of redirecting the user to the target.
special pages
Some redirects to other projects and special pages use the template {{}}; however, shortcuts that are a soft redirects will appear in the pool of pages that are selected by . Soft redirects are categorised into .
