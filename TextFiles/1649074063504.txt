The leather based products are a big part of garments, footwear and accessories for luxury goods industry. The leather based products majorly includes shoes, bags, belts, clothes, suitcases, car accessories etc. The designing course for leather goods imparts comprehensive knowledge about leather raw materials, processing, product care, industrial training and tours as well as other aspects of the luxury goods industry such as fashion forecast, brand awareness, traditional and modern practices of leather designing.
All the luxurious brands globally have products based on leather material be it organic or synthetic leather therefore, the billion dollar industry has great scope for leather designers. Leather is considered luxurious good because of the raw materials used (some are exotic like snake skin, alligator skin etc.) and also processing involved such as tanning and designing, therefore high cost of manufacturing.
In addition to the high cost of manufacturing, leather goods are durable and superior products, and with innovative designs (including personalisation and customisation), the demand in market is really high. Consumers are ready to spend big bucks for good valued leather products like footwear, handbags, backpacks, luggage, belts, wallets and other accessories.
Leather designing in fashion and luxury goods industry provides great opportunities to explore the industry world-wide. A person specialising in leather designing can work as leather apparel designing, leather accessory designing, research and development for leather industry, or they can start up their own leather goods manufacturing unit.
A market research report by Technovia after analyzing leather goods industry of major leather goods manufacturers forecasted that the industry is expected to grow at a considerable rate and can go beyond revenue of US Dollar 250 billion in the next five years. It also predicted that to get competitive edge leather manufacturers should adopt new and improved technology along with trendsetting designs for producing organic leather products. Consequently, the scope of leather designing will be broadened.
