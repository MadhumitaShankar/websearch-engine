If you are a fresher and & are very sure that you can improve your Percentile in the next year then there is no stopping you, on the other hand, if you are you have gap years & you don't want to waste more time on only CAT then you can go ahead & learn the skills which will help you make Job ready.

Hi there! Yes, you can be eligible for MBA Admission with 80% in CAT. But many top-tier schools will consider your overall performance I. e. your record in bachelor's degree, your conduct in the GD/PI rounds besides just checking your competitive exams score. You should aim to have a good record in all the areas aforementioned. For instance, in IILM university Gurugram (which is the premier place to have your MBA degree from), eligibility criteria comprise of candidate's performance in -Bachelor's degree, Personal Interview and -competitive exams like CAT/MAT/XAT/CMAT/GMAT/ATMA/NMAT. I personally advise you to appear in most of these exams as this will improve your scope of selection. The best is to have a word with the programme advisors of the universities as this will help you to streamline your preparation and take informed decisions regarding your career in MBA.

No, it is not too early to start preparations for the CAT 2022 exam. There are many good IIMS, IITs, and other private institutes that provide admission to the students in an MBA degree programme based on their CAT exam percentile. Let me enlist a few good institutes names for the MBA degree that consider the CAT exam for an MBA.
