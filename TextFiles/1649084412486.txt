Jay Blades and the team bring three treasured family heirlooms, and the memories they hold, back to life.
First up are sisters Daisy and Indiana Perry with their father’s damaged motor bike saddle bags. They are here to entrust them with leather restoration expert Susie Fletcher. Their father, Mark, is a devoted biker and the bags have accompanied him on the open road for tens of thousands of miles. Unfortunately, Mark was involved in an accident on his bike ten years ago and suffered a brain injury, which means days out on his bike are limited. Daisy and Indiana know how much it would mean to him to have these trusty bags repaired and back on his bike for his precious final rides, and fellow motorbike fan Suzie is only too happy to help.
Mechanical marvel Steve Fletcher welcomes Ben Chaffe to the workshop with his late grandfather’s barometer. Ben spent holidays as a child at his grandparents’ house on the Dorset coast, and every morning the barometer was consulted before each day’s activities were planned. Its predictions were taken very seriously, and young Ben was very impressed with its accuracy. The barometer was left to him when his dear grandfather died, for which he felt honoured. It hung in his kitchen, until one fateful day, when the nail that supported it gave way and it smashed on the floor tiles. Steve needs patience, know-how and a bit of good fortune to get this gadget going.
Lastly, stained-glass craftsman Matt Nickels and blacksmith Dom Chinea join forces to work on a decorative window panel with a remarkable story. Johnathan Shonfeld is the proud owner of the one-hundred-year-old stained glass panel, which sat above his grandparents' front door in North London. His family were heroes during the holocaust, rescuing hundreds of Jewish children from across Europe and Johnathan is keen to preserve this piece of important history.
