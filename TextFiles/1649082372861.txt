Why aren't all programmes available to download?




There are several reasons why a programme may be unavailable for download (). Unfortunately, as there are so many different programmes on the BBC, we can't talk about specific programmes or episodes, but these are some of the reasons the content may be unavailable for download.
where the download option is greyed out

It's not possible to download programmes that are currently broadcasting. A downloadable version of the programme may be available shortly after it has finished its broadcast. Not all live episodes will be downloadable due to the other reasons listed on this page.
Live programmes



If a programme has only become available in the past few minutes, there may be a delay in processing the download files. This is most likely if the programme was broadcast live or close to live (recently recorded) and the files could not be prepared in advance. Try checking again later.
The programme has only just been made available to stream
