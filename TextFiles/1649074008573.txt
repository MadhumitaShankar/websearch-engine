It is a perfect college for students who really want to get exposure to technology.

Placements:
I will pass out in 2024. I don't have any experience yet, but the placement records are almost the top in the country. The average package offered last year was around 16 LPA, and I am very happy about it.

Infrastructure:
I haven't visited the hostel yet, due to the pandemic. But I saw many photos and spoke with my seniors about this. Their review is awesome. Mess food charges are slightly high, but the food quality is also good. Every hostel has separate grounds and canteens. Our wing group is awesome.

IIT Bombay: totally worth my JEE training.

Placements:
Pretty decent amount of placements in Non-core sector but hardly any for the core. Packages were average. Not a single offer was high but the lowest package was also not that disappointing. Companies coming here have a pretty good idea about our curriculum and interviews are quite challenging.

Infrastructure:
It has Wi-Fi, a Study room, TV room, as well as indoor sports lounge. Rooms are really worse as compared to other hostels around the country. Hygiene is really bad. The culture of the hostel is healthy with...
