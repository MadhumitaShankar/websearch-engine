The importance of Computer Science/IT cannot be undermined in the current times. This single branch of engineering has undergone a sea change and offers a myriad of career prospects to its students. Lovely Professional University is one of the best universities to pursue B.Tech. To commence with the curriculum, all the subjects you will study, their syllabus is designed keeping in mind the industry demands and company officials vet the syllabus. Different specializations are offered to students depending upon the stream they want to opt for. For example- In CSE, they provide cybersecurity, IoT, data Science, machine learning, and many more. Moreover, they give you the option for pathway electives: whether you want to be in the corporate sector, higher studies, Government Job, or entrepreneur. LPU has industrial tie-ups with numerous organizations for hands-on practical training and certifications in collaborations with the world's top brands. LPU has tied up with top companies to offer industrial training to B.Tech. Students at no extra fee. Right from Google, Microsoft, SAP, Bosch India to Amazon India, Tech Mahindra, Oracle, Cadence, Cisco, Lovely Professional University has the centers of excellence and tie-ups with many of the world's leaders and IT giants. And, this is how LPU ensures that its students are industry-ready and are accepted globally, in all streams. LPU has even tie-ups with companies like Upgrade, CompTia, Geeks for Geeks, etc. For a few B.Tech specializations. The University also provides the option of credit transfer and international exposure to their students. If I talk about the placements, the placement preparation is started from the very first year. Students are being given placement-oriented classes and even company-specific input also. Thousands of LPU students have got placed in top MNCs and are working all over the Globe. The highest Package Availed by Engineering (CSE) Student MS Tanya Arora is 42 LPA for batch 2020 by Microsoft. Students are placed in WorkIndia at 35 LPA; CLOUDERA at 31 LPA; AMAZON at a package of 30 LPA. An average package ranges from 5-10 LPA. Every year visiting companies escalate in number and till date University has recorded the highest placements in North India. The last is about extra-curricular activities. There is a separate division known as the Division of Student Welfare where there are various clubs that a student can join. Hope this helps! Thanks.

Dear Aspirant, Do not worry if you have dropped a year for the NDA preparation. You can take admission to the B.Tech (CSE) programme if you fulfill the eligibility criteria for the same. Many good institutes offer B.Tech (CSE) and every institute has its eligibility criteria. Being an alumnus of LPU I would share the eligibility criteria for B.Tech (CSE). To get admission you should have a minimum of 60% marks in the 12th class with mandatory subjects English Math, and Physics. Moreover, you need to qualify for the LPU NEST exam conducted by LPU. If you have not studied English as a subject, then you must have to provide proof of medium of instruction in English from your school or college. Also, you have to justify your gap of one year and it is not a big deal. I would like to tell you that the maximum package availed by the student for CSE is Rs. 42 LPA. CSE students get many specializations while studying CSE to enhance their knowledge according to their interests such as Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Cloud Computing, Cyber Security, Data Science, etc. I hope this helps. Good Luck!

LPU offers AI and machine learning. You would study AI in the 2nd year of CSE and you can choose ML as an Engineering Minor in the 3rd year of the B.Tech (CSE). I will try to answer your question to the best of my knowledge. Talking about Lovely Professional University, student of CSE here in LPU. LPU has a collaboration with Google to provide specialisation Android courses to the B.Tech/IT/CSE/Engineering students. LPU provides free training on SAP Business Suite to the students leading them to the SAP Consultant Certification. LPU has a tie-up with VMware IT ACADEMY for giving students and faculty exposure to products like vSAN, sphere, NSX, Workspace, Airwatch and cloud, including certifications. LPU was ranked SECOND by Hacker Earth leaving behind most IITs among more than 5000 universities, from all around the world. LPU students designed and created India's 1st Solar-Powered driverless bus which was featured in various national media and which made a maiden run in the Indian Science Congress 2019 held by LPU, which was inaugurated by The Prime Minister of India Shri Narendra Modi. And many more, with great placement opportunities, there is a very good holistic environment for one to study and get ready for the corporate world while sharpening your skills and knowledge. The placements at LPU are almost unexpectable. Someone gets a really good package while some get very less, it depends upon your portfolio and the interview. Mostly, the interviews matter a lot. If you did well over there you will definitely get a good job. Recently in the Amazon placement drive, 15-16 students got a package in the range of 11-16 Lacs and it's a good package, Tanya Arora she got 42 LPA from Microsoft. But at the same point, there are some companies who took the students at the package of 3.5-34.5 Lacs. There will be many placement drives conducted by Tech Mahindra, Samsung, Koni Labs, Hitachi, Honda and many more. It depends on how you perform. Innovative and productive environment, more emphasize on practical sessions with the benefit of having ragging free campus.

A BBA combined with an MBA would be a fantastic professional choice. It would be a wise decision to choose LPU because, in the current situation, this is the university that caters to the all-round growth of its students and nourishes them with care to propel their careers to a pinnacle of ultimate achievement that many would envy. I believe that taking an integrated course at LPU not only saves a year but is also financially feasible. In terms of curriculum, exposures, and placements, LPU, in my opinion, has an advantage. The following are some of the significant highlights of this LPU course: The Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs (ACBSP) of the United States has granted the School of Business accreditation for its Management, Commerce, and Economics programmes. In the coveted NIRF 2021 ranking given by The Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), Government of India, the school is placed No. 2 in India in Outreach and Inclusivity and 38th overall. Diversity: The school has students from all 50 states as well as more than 500 international students. Students have worked with organisations such as Himalaya Wellness, Bonn Biscuits, Sony, Colgate, Modern Food, Capgemini, Oyo Rooms, Decathlon, Big Bazaar, Godrej, Lyoness, EduIsFun, Republic Motors, Facebook, Sitaby, Cloud Buy, Training Wizards, Design Lounge, and others on their Live Projects. Students can earn money while learning by participating in business projects.

CU, Chitkara, PEC, UPES, Graphic Era, UIET and Galgotias are good universities. Being a faculty of LPU I would like to tell you about LPUs B Tech CSE programme. The B Tech CSE programme is one programme that LPU is known for. Well-tailored course content to meet the global industrial needs, good faculty, and state-of-the-art facilities have left many NITs far behind. The B Tech CSE programme primarily deals with the development as well as designing of computer software and hardware processes with a strong focus on courses related to algorithms, computation, programming languages, programme design, computer hardware, computer software, databases, operating systems, computer networking, etc. That are needed to build and solve problems using computers The curriculum taught here is of international standard. Highlights 1. The CSE dept. Of LPU has various tie-ups with Google, Pega, VMWARE, AUTOMATION ANYWHERE, INFORMATICA, COMPUTING TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION (CompTIA). The university has state-of-the-art labs with the latest software to provide hands-on practical exposure to students. 2. IITs and NITs are also appreciating campus-wide facilities in terms of IT. 3. Online access to research journals, leading company annual reports and business dissertations with design analysis for ERP. 4. Design and Development of software and databases for data analysis. 5. Option to opt for industry-relevant and industry-delivered skills to enhance placement prospects. 6. Student-driven activities for leadership and technological development 7. Software exhibitions on applications and research projects. 8. Backup and support by top companies for academics and curriculum like Microsoft, IBM, Cognizant, etc. LPU always designed the innovative pedagogy of the courses based on Industry standards only. Based on the same students are getting Industry ready from Day one. The maximum salary offered was 40 LPA and the average salary was 5.7lpa. Recently, an LPU student Tanya Arora got placed in Microsoft with 42 LPA this year.

I will try to answer your question to the best of my knowledge. Talking about Lovely Professional University, student of CSE here in LPU. LPU has a collaboration with Google to provide specialisation Android courses to the B.Tech/IT/CSE/Engineering students. LPU provides free training on SAP Business Suite to the students leading them to the SAP Consultant Certification. LPU has a tie-up with VMware IT ACADEMY for giving students and faculty exposure to products like vSAN, sphere, NSX, Workspace, Airwatch and cloud, including certifications. LPU was ranked SECOND by Hacker Earth leaving behind most IITs among more than 5000 universities, from all around the world. LPU students designed and created India's 1st Solar-Powered driverless bus which was featured in various national media and which made a maiden run in the Indian Science Congress 2019 held by LPU, which was inaugurated by The Prime Minister of India Shri Narendra Modi. And many more, with great placement opportunities, there is a very good holistic environment for one to study and get ready for the corporate world while sharpening your skills and knowledge. The placements at LPU are almost unexpectable. Some gets a really good package while some get very less, it depends upon your portfolio and the interview. Mostly, the interviews matter a lot. If you did well over there you will definitely get a good job. Recently in the Amazon placement drive, 15-16 students got a package in the range of 11-16 Lacs. Tanya Arora got 42 LPA from Microsoft. But at the same point, there are some companies who took the students at the package of 3.5-34.5 Lacs. There will be many placement drives conducted by Tech Mahindra, Samsung, Koni Labs, Hitachi, Honda and many more. It depends on how you perform. Innovative and productive environment, more emphasize on practical sessions with the benefit of having ragging free campus LPU is having experienced, specialised and well qualified faculty members. 70+ faculty / staff members have been from foreign countries, faculty from IIT, IIM and IIIT as we are concerned about the betterment of the students and long term growth of our University. At present, there are around 70 faculty members from IIT, IIMS, IIITs etc. Hope this will help you!

LPU understands the social corporate responsibility and believes in holding hands of the needy. Hence, in a bid to owe the social responsibility towards the needy, and give a token to the meritorious, LPU offers a range of scholarships and financial aid. You do not have to apply for a scholarship every time you pay the fee. What you get at the time of admission, continues till the course is over. However, the criteria are different for those who have sought admission through sports quota, board toppers, and performing arts. If you are a board topper and someone from the sports category and extracurricular performance category, you will have to either maintain a CGPA or keep performing in sports or extracurricular activities as the case may be. Otherwise, if you have got a scholarship through LPU NEST then you are not bound to maintain your academic or sports performance. There are other scholarships the university offers. Marks based (for previous two qualifying Exams) Performance in other National Level Entrance test Performance in Sports, Performance in Cultural, R&amp;D, Co-curricular, Social Services, Bravery Special Scholarship for Toppers of Education Board Financial Aid for Defense /CAPF and their dependents Financial Aid for Orphan Candidates Financial Aid for Persons with certain disabilities LPUNEST Study Grant Minorities Transgender Non Traditional student Need Based-Financial Aid EWS scholarship for those whose family income is less than 5 lacs Single girl child Single Mother Orphan. LPU offers a special scholarship of Full Tuition fee waiver to Indian resident orphan students whose both parents are dead. The university gives scholarships based on a first come first serve basis to 10 applicants. The candidate having a benchmark disability of more than 70% and/or Locomotor disability caused by spinal cord injury can avail the benefit of a full programme fee waiver. However, the LPU committee scrutinizes the case. LPU offers exclusive Scholarship schemes for Tibetan Students studying in CTA (Central Tibetan Administration) Schools and Students studying in different schools managed by Vidya Bharati Akhil Bharatiya Shiksha Sansthan where based on tests conducted in schools of the concerned organisation and/or recommendation of the concerned authority of the organisation, certain students may be offered full tuition fee waiver.
