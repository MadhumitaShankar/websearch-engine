The college has its own incubation cell and the famous T-Hub which promotes students ideas.

Placements:
Around 95% of the total college students were placed, with a median package of 21 lakh per annum and the lowest package of around 4 lakh. Since the course is a research based course, the duration depends on how fast the thesis is submitted and approved. From the passing out batch of my course, around 75% of them have sat for placements and have a 100% acceptance rate, while the remaining 25% have pursued higher studies (PhD). The college does not recommend research students to do internships sin...

Placements:
The course B.Tech in CS with MS in human sciences by research started with my batch only. So we don't have any concrete data about placements but a somewhat similar course to ours EHD had 100% placements in the past years, with some of the seniors with excellent jobs.

Infrastructure:
LAN is available to all the students except first years, medical facilities are not good, there is no ambulance for emergencies, food is above average as we have four messes with option to eat in any. The sports facilities are avera...

It has an amazing hostel and food, excellent placements every year and really good infrastructure.

Placements:
Our course CHD is a new one which has started in the previous year only. However, it derives somewhat from the EHD course which was available in IIITH and was stopped 5 years ago. I feel pleasure to study on the campus in the last batch of EHD, and the previous batch just passed out this year. So, placements are still pending. Most of them have been offered PPOs, but the placements have been good for the batches previous to that batch.

Infrastructure:
Our college has excellent infrastructure, and the entire building called Nilgiri is allotted for labs. Moreover, another building called KCIS is dedicated to research. Along with that, there are two more buildings for teaching, tutorials, etc. The food served is amazing, and there are 4 messes. Every mess serves a different cuisine. Hostels are clean, and there are services for cleaning, security, etc. Canteens here are famous, and they surely serve good food. As far as sports and games are cons...

1) Placements in computer Science department is 100 percent with avg package of 23 Lacs/annum. Placements for ECE is also close to 100 percent. So overall if we see dual degree and B.Tech have good placements here. 2) The highest package was 40 Lacs/ per annum, the lowest 6 Lacs/annum and average was 23 Lacs/annum. 3) Microsoft, De Shaw, Goldman Sachs, Adobe, Zomato, Flipkart, Samsung, Uber, Jio are the top recruiting companies. 4) Data scientist, web development designer, network administrator ...

All students from our senior batches were placed. Most of the placements are offered in top 4 IT companies of the world. In 2019, Apple visited our college for placements first time in India.

Placements:

The highest salary package offered is more than 1 crore per annum. The college provides both domestic and international placements. Internship data is not clear. There is a coding culture in college. If you like coding, then you will not find a better place than here in India.

Placements:
I don't think I need to say much about the placements of IIIT Hyderabd. It is certainly one of the best colleges in the country. Because of the coding culture here, you'll learn much more after your first 2 years here than any other college. And because of that, you will get superb internships and placement opportunities. This year onwards, Apple has started coming to the college for on-campus placements as well. That's enough said. The detailed package details are already given on the Shiksha w...

Regarding ECE, placements are on par with IIT's. The average salary package was 13.8 lacs per annum, the lowest was 7 LPA, and the highest was 25 LPA. Here, ECE students have many opportunities. Here, the students can feel the research culture. Even undergraduate students can do research in their 3 and 4th years. We have different research labs, and the students join in one of the labs and assist the professor in their work, and this gives an industrial feel. It depends on the student whether th...
