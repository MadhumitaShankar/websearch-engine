Is Boris Johnson right about 'biggest tax cut for 25 years'?





Reality Check



Boris Johnson said earlier: “What we’re doing with income tax and National Insurance… it’s the biggest tax cut for 25 years."
The prime minister is correct to say that the measures proposed in the Spring Statement last Wednesday, if taken in isolation, amount to a larger tax cut than any announced in a Budget over the last 25 years.
The chancellor said the government would increase the amount you can earn without paying any National Insurance starting this July and would cut the basic rate of tax in 2024.
But that’s not the full picture. If you look at all the measures announced by the government in the last year, they mean that people will be paying more tax in 2024 than they are at the moment.

How much is the government gaining from petrol prices?





Reality Check



The chancellor has announced a 5p per litre cut in fuel duty in his Spring Statement, as motorists struggle with rising prices.
Bear in mind the tax take from petrol and diesel increases as prices rise.
The average price of a litre of petrol has risen more than 40p a litre since last year’s Spring Statement, which means the government is getting an extra 7p per litre in VAT, which is the other tax the government imposes on fuel.
Diesel prices are up by nearly 50p a litre, almost 9p of which is VAT.
So the chancellor can afford to cut fuel duty by 5p and still be making more per litre in tax than he did a year ago.

Has the UK sanctioned more banks?





Reality Check



UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss this morning told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: “We’ve frozen the assets of 10 major Russian banks. So far the EU has only frozen three and we encourage them to do more.”
She is correct that the UK has frozen the assets of 10 banks and the EU has managed three.
But the difference could be explained by there being more Russian assets in London.
"London is, by a very long distance, the preeminent global financial centre for international money (and more so for Russian money) and so inevitably this means that the UK must lead the way because there is more money here than anywhere else," Tom Keatinge, director of the centre for financial crime and security studies at the think-tank RUSI, told Reality Check.
