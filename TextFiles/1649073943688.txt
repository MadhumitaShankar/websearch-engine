When pursuing an engineering degree in any field, it is essential to pursue a practical educational approach. A practical approach refers to the ability to recognize and solve real-world problems. It is crucial to do so among the most important fields that determine a country's future capabilities in engineering, which is not one of them. However, nowadays, a career is not limited to a job where one is employed by an employer or a multinational corporation (MNC) but can include various options such as entrepreneurship, research, and many others. When it comes to Automobile Engineering at Chandigarh University, I have to say that I was presented with nearly all of the options available to me. Let us take a look at a few of them. First and foremost, pursuing an Engineering degree at Asia's the fastest-growing university with a sprawling campus is a pleasant experience for us. Also crucial in automobile engineering are student-friendly instructors who have a strong command of the subjects, not only theoretically but also practically. In the Automobile Department, emphasis is placed on hands-on experience, projects, and industrial visits to provide students with a broad range of exposure to the current market environment.
