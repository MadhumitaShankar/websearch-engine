For CDS in IMA can I do B.Sc. with Maths?

The minimum qualification for CDS is graduation in any of the stream/course. Also, B.Sc. In Mathematics is completely theoretical, if you are thinking that what you'll study in graduation will help you in CDS examination, well this is not the case. The syllabus for both is completely different.

Yes it will work. The minimum education qualification required to appear for CDS is that a candidate must have passed Bachelor's degree in any discipline from a recognised board. Candidates who are in final year of the qualifying exam are also eligible.
