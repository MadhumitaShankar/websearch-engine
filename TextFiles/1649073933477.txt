Hello! Vivek Patidar, it's very nice to hear from you that you are interested in doing your M.Tech albeit in part time mode. It's a very good idea. Of course you will have to work hard but I am sure that you are willing. You can do part time course only from a college co-located where you are working. This is so, since model followed is few classes in evening and more time during SAT Right? I would like to advise you to begin with finding names and telephone numbers of all such colleges offering M.Tech. Then ringing each one to know if they offer part time course. Once you get to know such colleges then you can take concerned entrance exam etc. Best wishes to you.
