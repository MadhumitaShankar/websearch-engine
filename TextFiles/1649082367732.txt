How long are programmes available for?




We aim to make programmes available for as long as possible. And while much of our content is available for 30 days after broadcast, many more programmes are becoming available for longer (365 days or more). So you don’t miss out, we display how long a programme is available just below its description on the playback page.



Most programmes are available to download (on the mobile/tablet app or on your computer) and will have the same availability as it would if you were streaming it.

It may take a while to make a programme available on demand after broadcast if the programme was live or recorded close to live. Rather than wait, you may be able to .

rewind the live TV channel by up to 2 hours
Some films may not be available either to watch live or on demand.
We're busy working towards making even more programmes available for longer.


Programmes with a longer availability

Some current affairs programmes, such as HARDtalk, Click and Panorama, are available for 365 days
Most BBC Three programmes are available for more than a year
More drama, documentaries, comedy and children's series are becoming available for longer

Programmes available for 30 days

Much of our content is available for 30 days. However, if a programme is repeated, its availability will be extended, usually for another 30 days.

Programmes with a shorter availability

News bulletins may only be available for up to 24 hours after broadcast or until the next bulletin is broadcast
For legal reasons, Crimewatch Roadshow is only available for 24 hours after broadcast
Some sport coverage and films may have a shorter availability
Sometimes we'll remove a programme for editorial/legal reasons; when we do this, we list it on our

known issues page
Can you extend the availability of a programme if I get in touch?

Unfortunately not. But please be assured that we always try to make programmes available as long as our rights allow.
You can, however, check to see if a programme is going to be repeated in the near future by visiting the programme website for a particular programme. If you're using BBC iPlayer through a web browser, a link is displayed at the bottom left of the playback page.
