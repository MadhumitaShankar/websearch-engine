The college provides a really good course curriculum, faculty, exposure, and placements.

Placements:
Placement report of the college is CRISIL audited. Hence the figures are not inflated, and they are true. The average salary package offered is 22.9 LPA. The median salary package offered is 22.0 LPA. The highest salary package offered is 46.5 LPA. The lowest salary package offered is 12 LPA. Almost 72% of the batch got a salary package of more than 20 LPA. Almost 100% of the students are placed, i.e., around 239 students. Almost 111 recruiters visited the campus for placements. Almost 12 intern...

A B-school which is different and I loved the environment.

Placements:
The college is one of the best b-schools in India, yet very few people know that placements in SPJIMR are on par with IIM A, B and C and better than XLRI, FMS or any other IIMs. The average placement package is approximately 23 LPA for the 2016-18 batch. It was approximately 22 LPA for the batch before.

Infrastructure:
Infrastructure is where the college trails behind old IIMs and XL. Having said that, SPJIMR has improved a lot in the last 2-3 years. The lush green campus in the middle of Andheri West which is o...

The college provides a well-balanced course structure with both academic and non-academic subjects like DOCC, GFT and Abhyudaya. Above all, there is a lot of learning that comes through interaction with your peers. It has a highly competitive environment and well-qualified teaching staff. I will rate this college as low on infrastructure, high on location and placements.

I am absolutely satisfied. SPJIMR GMP provides opportunities for an international career.

Placements:
After completing 6 months of course at SPJIMR, all the students study in its partner universities. Thus most of them get placed internationally. But there is no direct placement support from our college, but in-directly a lot of help is provided through networking events and career fairs. There is always a risk and problem with courses like GMP, etc., but the great alumni network of SPJIMR and GMP helps students to connect with each other and share all the possible ways for opportunities.

It is a very good balance of courses, the best of schools, and value for money.

Placements:
In GMP, since graduation happens at the partner university, the placement rules apply to the specific country that you are in. You have to keep in mind that international placements are not offered. So getting a job is very much dependent on how resourceful you are. However, you get conceptually very well trained at SPJIMR from your first semester and very good hands-on industry experience in the partner schools in the following semesters. The knowledge together makes you a very employable resou...

The college teaches its students to become future business leaders.

Placements:
There were many batches for this course, and each batch has a strength of 35 students, and I am a student of batch 54. Students got placed in different companies like BPCL, NRL, L&T, SAP, Mahindra & Mahindra, Tata Motors and Tata Steel. As all the students in the batch were already working, hence campus placements were not necessary. We had to attend classes of 9 days in each quarter, and the course was divided into C0 to C7. Most of the students were offered middle management level roles in the...

The college is satisfactory, and it is helping us well.

Placements:
Most people here are for joining their family businesses and make it big and learn how to face the challenges. So they don't focus on getting a job.

Infrastructure:
We have all the required facilities here on the campus. Wi-Fi, E-books, cricket field, gym, football field, are available on the campus. There is a hostel facility. There are air-conditioned rooms and classrooms. Water and food quality is also nice, and we have food and service is available almost 24x7.

One of the Top B-schools in the country, ranking among Top 10 in most surveys if not all. Extremely liberal faculty. Takes ample advantage of its location being in Mumbai, leveraging the industry presence in the city. Campus infrastructure might disappoint, but Upgradation is in process, and has gathered steam already.

Greatly satisfied. Great placements, great learning exposure, and yes, improving infrastructure.

Placements:
The placements are pretty good at SPJIMR. 100% placements happen every year. The average CTC was around 20 lpa for the 2017 batch. Financial companies, FMCG companies, tech companies, and consulting companies visited the campus last year. Many roles like consulting, product management, equity research, sales and marketing, and supply chain roles were offered to the participants.

Infrastructure:
Although SPJIMR is not known for its infrastructure, there have been a lot of developments happening to improve the same. A new academic building is being constructed which is scheduled to start functioning from the next academic year. Hostels are present in the campus on 2 and 3 sharing basis. A canteen named Spice and Spoon is present on the campus and offers good quality vegetarian food. The classrooms have been revamped recently. There has been a great deal of investment made by the college ...

GMP, being an international programme, has placements of international standards. There are no placement cells in the partner universities, but they have a career service cell where you get complete exposure to various types of companies of all industries. The risk element is always present, but the opportunities are vast and so are the returns. Different partner universities offer different courses with different specialisations. So, it is difficult to mention the average salary package. But cu...
