Aerial





So you are not sure if you have a UHF aerial?
If you are in a shared building like an apartment block it's best to check with your building manager.
If you live in a house or unit, just pop outside and have a look at your roof or high on the side of your building and see if there is an antenna up there. If there is then see if you can match it with one or more of these.

None





Not sure what you have at home?
Simply tap or click on the relevant 'i's above each option to see what to look out for.
In order to make the most out of your Freeview Play TV or recorder, you will need a working TV aerial, plugged in securely to the aerial socket in the back of your TV or recorder. Plus a broadband connection, connected to your TV or recorder via Wi-Fi or an Ethernet cable directly from your router if it is near enough.

Satellite





So you are not sure if you have a satellite?

Wifi





Connecting your Freeview Play TV to your broadband
In order to make the most out of your Freeview Play TV or recorder you will need to connect it to your broadband using Wi-Fi* (or an Ethernet cable directly from your router if it is near enough).
Most TVs now include the option to connect using Wi-Fi and as long as you have a connection speed of more than 2Mbps you should be able to watch catch up TV.
