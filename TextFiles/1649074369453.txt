Overview

YouTube Kids

Supervised experience on YouTube
beta


We recommend that you use if you plan on allowing children under 13 to watch independently. We built YouTube Kids to create a safer environment for children to explore their interests and curiosity, while giving you controls in the app that enable you to customise your children's experience. You can create individual profiles for each child, decide what content to make available, block videos or channels that you don't want your children to see, set a timer to limit screen time, see recent videos that your children have been watching and much more.

YouTube Kids
YouTube Kids is a dedicated app built from the ground up with children in mind. It was launched in 2015 to give children a safer and simpler place to explore their interests through online video. This separate app is a filtered version of YouTube and has a much smaller set of channels and videos available than the YouTube app and website. This is because we work to identify content that is age-appropriate, adheres to our quality principles and is diverse enough to meet the varied interests of children globally.
Millions of viewers use YouTube Kids every week, and we strive to offer ways for all types of parents to create an experience that works best for the individual needs of their child and family. Parents can choose from three age-based content levels (Preschool, Younger, Older) or decide to hand-pick only the videos, channels and collections of content that they want their child to watch.

Supervised experience on YouTube
beta
In 2021 we launched a new choice for parents who've decided that their tweens or teens are ready to explore YouTube with a supervised account. Parents link their child's Google Account to their own before granting them access to YouTube and then choose from content settings that generally align with content ratings for pre-teens and older.
The experience looks much like YouTube's flagship app and website, but with adjustments to the content that a child can find and watch, features that they can use, default account settings and ad protections. The experience also works with , offering additional parental controls to help guide children as they learn, play and explore online.
