Hi Aspirant, well, yes IIBS is the best option for your MBA and PGDM studies. Bangalore is one of the highly developed cities in India with bustling business activities. Especially, its information technology and management sector are undergoing a massive growth in the past few years. This has inspired a large number of entrepreneurs, educational organizations, investors and Multi-National Companies (MNCs) from worldwide to establish their foundation in Bangalore.

LPU is the best for an MBA in Healthcare Management in terms of quality studies and great placements. LPU offers various opportunities to MBA students to enhance their knowledge in both studies and extracurricular activities. The Mittal School of Business at LPU is accredited by Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs, USA ensuring quality education and industry-experienced faculty members, studying in LPU will get a degree accredited from a body of USA. Placement: Companies like Colgate Palmolive, Hindustan Unilever, Godrej Consumer, Asian Paints, Bajaj Allianz, CEAT, Rallis India, etc. Visit LPU for recruitment purposes. The main thing for placement that I liked there is that LPU provides placement classes to the students from the first year, which helps students prepare for placement until their final year of the programme. The highest package offered for the management programme is Rs. 21 LPA. Scholarships: LPU provides very good scholarships on the basis of Percentage in Qualifying Exam/ Qualification previous to Eligibility Qualification, LPU NEST CAT/ MAT/ XAT/ CMAT or NMAT Financial Aid, Need-Based, Financial Aid for Serving/ Retired Defence/ CAPF/ Para- Military Personnel and their dependents, Financial Aid to Persons with Certain Disabilities.

The rural management MBA programme focuses on rural areas, cooperatives, agribusiness, and similar fields. The scope of an MBA in Rural Management, however, is broad and not limited to employment in the rural sector only. Regardless of the specialization, the focus of the MBA programme stays the same that is in any management specialisation, you are taught marketing, finance, human resources, and operations. When students enrol in courses in Rural Management, they receive instruction in all aspects of business and management, so the scope of employment is not restricted to rural areas only. The Institute of Rural Management Anand (IRMA) is one of the best management schools in the country where students can enrol to discover work prospects in a variety of fields. Students with a management Diploma from the institute will be hired by India's leading companies.

There is no constraint whatsoever. And in most cases, students with rural management background understand the rural markets way better than their counterparts from mainstream management institutions. But corporate world is not what education in rural management prepares you for. It's aim is to provide management talent to institutions working in development space, or create social change engineers who spawn their own developmental organisations. I'd suggest go for a mainstream MBA if you want to have comparative advantages in corporate world.

Christ university is known for the training and placement services it offers to the students. Each department has a placement representative and they organise career development programmes and upskilling trainings for interested students. Bachelor of business administration is an excellent course for any student as this course directly equips a student with management and development theoretical concepts. Studying this course at a degree level prepares any student for running a business, managing or governing a business efficiently. So, according to me, you should definitely go for this course at Christ University.

Nowadays many students pursue MBA by securing admission to an average management college. However, pursuing MBA from an average MBA college you may not be able to acquire a job with a good salary package. This is why it is important to earn your MBA degree from a reputed and recognised institute like Sanskriti University. It provides a good placement record and the starting salary per annum from this placement may vary from 5 Lacs to 20 Lacs depending upon the company where you get placed. Over the years, Sanskriti University has developed its reputation, not in academic excellence but also in having good placement records and experienced faculty. It is able to place its students in reputed companies with good packages because it encashes its reputation with having tie-up with big MNCs and financial institutions.

PGDM can only be offered by AICTE approved colleges and is a Diploma programme that is equivalent to a degree and the syllabus is dynamic and upgraded. Almost all the Iims and other top colleges also offer PGDM. If your goal is to get into the Corporates right after your management course you can go for PGDM. MBA is a degree programme offered by UGC-recognized and AICTE approved universities or by colleges affiliated with those universities. If you wish to pursue Ph.D. after your management education you can go for it. Although the PGDM syllabus is more dynamic and upgraded than MBA, good colleges always make up by providing extra knowledge that may not be there in the syllabus because their main goal is to make each and every candidate placed. RIIM, PUNE is one such TOP college that offers both MBA and PGDM and their placement record is 100%.
