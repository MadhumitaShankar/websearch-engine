Fully satisfied of my overall IIM A experience.

Placements:
Placements were excellent. IIM A has cluster system (with companies of same field arriving on same day), almost 40% of batch I guess had offers by the end of cluster 1 (I. e. Consulting & Finance firms), including PPOs and lateral offers. 100% of students got placed. The highest, the lowest and Average can't be calculated since a number of companies don't give salary details in the Job Description Forms. But the highest for domestic would definitely be more than or equal to 50 LPA. Around 100+ ...

Nothing in particular to complain about.

Placements:
Offers 100% placements typically. Recruiters are diverse in sector and size. Median packages should be around 18-19L per annum. Internship placements are 100% as well with median stipends around a 1L per month. PPO conversion rate is in line with market benchmarks.

Infrastructure:
Infrastructure leaves nothing to be hoped for. The systems are on point and facilitate optimum efficiency while working. Dorms do not have ACs although classes do. The quality of food is alright although if you are a veterinarian alth...

Good placements, top-class infrastructure, and world-renowned faculty

Placements:
IIM Ahmedabad follows a cluster system instead of a day system for placements wherein companies are categorized by function/industry/sector instead of pay or brand. The placement process is not oriented towards achieving 100% placements, it is purpose is to provide the best job-person fit. However, inevitably, the entire batch gets placed every time within 3 days. Major roles are across consulting, finance, marketing, general management, technology, etc. All the reputed Indian and global firms p...

IIM Ahmedabad - a short description.

Placements:
The placements of IIMA have been spectacular in the recent years, which is considered to be the best in the country. The institute leads in both national and international placements. In the two years that I have spent here (even before), the institute has never failed to achieve 100 percent placements for internships as well as final placements. The cluster process of the placement program gives the right opportunity to the students to choose the sector they want to join. Companies from sectors...

Awesome place to spend two years of life with great learning experience.

Review of IIM-Ahmedabad. The campus has a decent infrastructure.

Placements:
The college has a cluster system with almost 40% of batch getting placed at the end of the cluster. Placements were excellent for the seniors as well as the junior batch. Everybody gets placed within 2-3 days of the placement period. The college even provides internships to the students in reputed companies. Every known company in India visits our campus for the placement process. The placement cell is very active and helpful.

Infrastructure:
The campus has a decent infrastructure. There is a newly renovated lib...

It is the best college in India and most value for money.

Placements:
Placements for our batch were quite good and better than the placement record of the previous year. The lowest salary package offered was 19 LPA. The highest domestic salary package offered was 60 LPA. All the top companies visited, which included Amazon, Google, Microsoft, etc. Roles offered varied from CFO to marketing manager. The one year MBA programme doesn't have internships. There is a placement cell formed by students and recognised by the institute. The placement cell was very useful.

Infrastructure:
The institute provides a great Wi-Fi facility throughout the campus. It has the best library which can be used to get up to 6 books and if you don't find any book in the library, you can suggest library to purchase it which is done very quickly. The institute has a permanent doctor and various other specialist visits on a daily basis. All the sports facilities are available, including basketball, squash, volleyball, football, and cricket. The swimming pool is under construction. There are variou...

IIMA is mecca of MBA aspirants. It has a legacy of 60 years. The only institute of India which is ranked among the top 10 in the world. Selection procedure is even tougher than Harvard.

It is the best college for management, in India. It offers foreign exchange program for students with good international universities. The research and teaching credentials of the faculty are excellent. The infrastructure is a state of the art, e.g. Wi-Fi, LAN, library, classrooms, online assignment submission, etc. Internships and final placements in international companies at attractive remuneration are guaranteed. Rigorous coaching and serious study environment helps in studying.

IIMA - there's a reason the brand speaks for itself.

Placements:
Companies that come for recruitment keep changing year on year as per their recruiting needs, however, rest assured, if you have a good history of performance and you're hard working you're likely to get placed where you like, be it an MNC or a booming start-up. Some of the regular recruiters were Reckitt Benckiser, Mosanto, Syngenta, Pepsico, Godrej, Mahindra, ConAgra, Nestle, etc. The placement process during summers was (naturally) a bit less stressful. Having said that summers were considere...

The best management institution in the country in every single aspect. The curriculum is exhaustive and demanding. 'A' in IIMA is for academics, especially in the first year everyone needs to work hard to survive. Great electives in the second year. Good level professors and helpful administration make life easy. Unlimited opportunities in every field. Lot of societies and clubs to choose from. Placement opportunities are excellent.

Some people say A in IIM-A stands for academic rigor. First, that's a fact. The entire first year program is so gracefully packed, it will push you just to your limits. It’s not just about academics either, it’s about projects, clubs, sports and much more. The best part, however, is the people you get to meet here.

It is the best B-school in the country. The best part is the people, who join the campus. They are the toppers of their field and the interaction between them is intangible. The faculty is amazing and you can learn a lot from them. The case study pedagogy helps you understand the real life scenario. In short, it stands for its reputation of being the best B-School of India.

If your sole motivation to join IIM Ahmedabad is to increase your salary manifolds then drop the idea. I joined IIMA after 4 years of IT work experience with the expectation of coming out of IT sector and increasing my salary. However, once you are on the campus most of your assumption before joining will change. Your class will have best brains of India. And listening and discussing with them during the class will add considerable value to you and your thought process. The faculty is best in th...
