Aerospace engineering is the primary field of engineering concerned with the development of aircraft and spacecraft. It has two major and overlapping branches: aeronautical engineering and astronautical engineering. Aerospace engineering may be studied at the advanced Diploma, Bachelor's, master's, and Ph.D. levels in aerospace engineering departments at many universities, and in mechanical engineering departments at others. A few departments offer degrees in space-focused astronautical engineering. Some institutions differentiate between aeronautical and astronautical engineering. Graduate degrees are offered in advanced or specialty areas for the aerospace industry. A background in Chemistry Physics computer Science and mathematics is important for students pursuing an aerospace engineering degree.

The course for Aerospace Engineering has been designed for learners who intend to design aircraft, spacecraft, satellites, and missiles. In addition, these engineers test prototypes to make sure that they function according to plans. These professionals also design components and sub-assemblies for these craft like engines, airframes, wings. The course equips a student to be able to effectively build and communicate the solutions crafted using learnings from basic aerospace engineering, basic sciences, mathematics, and computational skills and tools. He will have the ability to comprehend the problems and craft solutions in the field of Aerodynamics, Aerospace structure, Aerospace Vehicle design, and propulsions. He will rightly apply the associated learning for the atmospheric Flight mechanics, JET And Rocket propulsions, Gas Dynamics, and Space Flight Mechanics for the solutions to real-world problems. He would demonstrate the ability to propose cost-effective optimized solutions for the aerospace sector using a simulated environment of Computer-aided design, computer-aided manufacturing, and computer-aided engineering. As per the NIRF ranking, LPU is ranked 66th among all government and private universities. As per The Times of India ranking, LPU was at no 36. The highest package offered in the course is about 31 LPA. The average salary was 4.8 LPA.

Aerospace Engineering in Chandigarh University is really Good. The department developed a lot and has more to do and explore with the lab facilities available. Its a place where teachers always ask to do something new beside learning about aerospace. These new outcomes from the pupils of the departments results into Review Papers, Research Papers and Patents. And indeed Aerospace Department holds a good rate of filing patent and publishing papers in its Bachelor course only! Its a place where you can feel that passion of doing aerospace, as your ideas are always welcomed first! And There's a lot more Advantages of the foreign university tie ups for the aerospace only. With a NAAC A+ graded institute, and a very high rate of development, one can catch the heights of the sky and space.

This is a huge number and will give a good impact on future students. As CU tries to place every student with good packages. Admission to the programme is based on the marks obtained in 10+2 or equivalent and the qualifying marks in CUCET I can't say anything about other universities but Chandigarh University is one of the super best universities in India. Chandigarh University is vast in a number of campus areas and population. The faculty here is top class and the atmosphere is safe and ragging free.

The best aviation structures research facility is located at Chandigarh University, and it includes testing related to material aspects as well as underlying mechanics. The concept is given in the seminars on strong mechanics and aviation structures forms the basis for these investigations to a large extent. Furthermore, for openness, many tests on vibrations and key elements are incorporated. The sheer attention of an open segment, as well as a closed section, will be observed in this experiment. It includes inclination and diversion assurance for merely supported radiates, fixed bars, cantilevers, and composite radiates.

There are many good universities to study B Tech Aerospace engineering. IIT Sastra Lovely Professional University Amritha SRM VIT Being a faculty of LPU I would like to tell you about the strengths of B Tech Aerospace at LPU. The course for Aerospace Engineering has been designed for learners who intend to design aircraft, spacecraft, satellites, and missiles. In addition, these engineers test prototypes to make sure that they function according to plans. These professionals also design components and sub-assemblies for these craft like engines, airframes, wings. The course equips a student to be able to effectively build and communicate the solutions crafted using learnings from basic aerospace engineering, basic sciences, mathematics, and computational skills and tools. He will have the ability to comprehend the problems and craft solutions in the field of Aerodynamics, Aerospace structure, Aerospace Vehicle design, and propulsions. He will rightly apply the associated learning for the atmospheric Flight mechanics, JET And Rocket propulsions, Gas Dynamics, and Space Flight Mechanics for the solutions to real-world problems. He would demonstrate the ability to propose cost-effective optimized solutions for the aerospace sector using a simulated environment of Computer-aided design, computer-aided manufacturing, and computer-aided engineering. As per the NIRF ranking, LPU is ranked 66th among all government and private universities. As per The Times of India ranking, LPU was at no 36. The highest package offered in the course is about 31 LPA. The average salary was 4.8 LPA. Recently, Gopalchetty Brahma and Vinay Kumar Reddy Andluri topped the youth category (over 18 years), while Sathwik Bikumalla won gold in the junior category (under 18 years) in the online competition prestigious International Astronomy and Astrophysics Competition (IAAC) 2021. All three are Aerospace Engineering students at Lovely Professional University. IAAC 2021, one of the world the largest astronomy competitions, registered over 4,700 participants, 1,300 of whom made it to the pre-final and final rounds. The participants were tested in their knowledge of astronomy and astrophysics.

Hello Vaskar Das, it's very nice to hear from you that your dream is to work at NASA. Like our own ISRO, NASA too requires specialists in different streams like mathematics, physics, mechanical engineering, medicine, metallurgy, etc. So frankly speaking you don't have to be an aeronautical engineer from IIT Mumbai to get a job in NASA. Don't feel pity for yourself for being physically challenged. There is a large number of such people who have achieved greatness in this world by sheer dint of hard work and determination. Of course, being a Govt institute, IIT Mumbai also reserves seats for physically challenged students and offers all help for them to be comfortable on their campus. Best wishes to you.
