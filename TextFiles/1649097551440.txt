In some hypertext, hyperlinks can be bidirectional: they can be followed in two directions, so both ends act as and as targets. More complex arrangements exist, such as many-to-many links.
anchors
The effect of following a hyperlink may vary with the hypertext system and may sometimes depend on the link itself; for instance, on the most hyperlinks cause the target document to replace the document being displayed, but some are marked to cause the target document to open in a new window (or, perhaps, in a new ). Another possibility is , for which the link target is a document that replaces the link anchor within the source document. Not only persons browsing the document follow hyperlinks. These hyperlinks may also be followed automatically by programs. A program that traverses the hypertext, following each hyperlink and gathering all the retrieved documents is known as a Web or .

inline link
An inline link may display a modified version of the content; for instance, instead of an image, a , , section, or section may be shown. The full content is then usually available on demand, as is the case with software – e.g., with an . This allows for smaller file sizes and quicker response to changes when the full linked content is not needed, as is the case when rearranging a .

Anchor links

An anchor hyperlink (anchor link) is a link bound to a portion of a document, which is often called a . The fragment is generally a portion of text or a heading, though not necessarily. For instance, it may also be a in an image ( in HTML), a designated, often irregular part of an image.

Fragments are marked with (in any of various ways), which is why a link to a fragment is called an anchor link (that is, a link to an anchor). For example, in XML, the element provides anchoring capability (as long as the DTD or schema defines it), and in , is a typical example of implementing it. In apps, anchors can be inserted where desired and may be called . In , the hash character (#) precedes the name of the anchor for the fragment.

One way to define a hot area in an image is by a list of coordinates that indicate its boundaries. For example, a may have each country hyperlinked to further information about that country. A separate invisible hot area interface allows for swapping or labels within the linked hot areas without repetitive embedding of links in the various skin elements.

Link behavior in web browsers

Cascading Style Sheets
In a graphical user interface, the appearance of a may change into a motif to indicate a link. In most graphical web browsers, links are displayed in underlined blue text when they have not been visited, but underlined purple text when they have. When the activates the link (e.g., by clicking on it with the mouse) the browser displays the link's target. If the target is not an HTML file, depending on the and on the browser and its , another program may be activated to open the file.

The HTML code contains some or all of the five main characteristics of a link:

("href" pointing to a URL)
link destination


link label

link title

link target
or
link class
link id
It uses the with the attribute "href" (HREF is an abbreviation for "Hypertext REFerence") and optionally also the attributes "title", "target", and "" or "id":
HTML element "a"

[13]
class


<a href="" title="" target="" class=""></a>
URL
link title
link target
link class
link label
To embed a link into a web page, blogpost, or comment, it may take this form:


<a href="https://example.com/">Example</a>
In a typical web browser, this would display as the underlined word "Example" in blue, which when clicked would take the user to the example.com website. This contributes to a clean, easy to read text or document.
By default, browsers will usually display hyperlinks as such:

An unvisited link is usually blue and underlined
A visited link is usually purple and underlined
An active link is usually red and underlined
When the cursor hovers over a link, depending on the browser and graphical user interface, some informative text about the link can be shown, popping up, not in a regular , but in a special , which disappears when the cursor is moved away (sometimes it disappears anyway after a few seconds, and reappears when the cursor is moved away and back). , , , and many other web browsers all show the URL. In addition, the URL is commonly shown in the .
window
hover box
Mozilla Firefox
IE
Opera
status bar
Normally, a link opens in the current or window, but sites that use frames and multiple windows for navigation can add a special "target" attribute to specify where the link loads. If no window exists with that name, a new window is created with the ID, which can be used to refer to the window later in the browsing session.
frame
Creation of new windows is probably the most common use of the "target" attribute. To prevent accidental reuse of a window, the special window names "_blank" and "_new" are usually available, and always cause a new window to be created. It is especially common to see this type of link when one large website links to an external page. The intention in that case is to ensure that the person browsing is aware that there is no endorsement of the site being linked to by the site that was linked from. However, the attribute is sometimes overused and can sometimes cause many windows to be created even while browsing a single site.
Another special page name is "_top", which causes any frames in the current window to be cleared away so that browsing can continue in the full window.

The term "link" was coined in 1965 (or possibly 1964) by at the start of . Nelson had been inspired by "", a popular 1945 essay by . In the essay, Bush described a microfilm-based machine (the ) in which one could link any two pages of information into a "trail" of related information, and then scroll back and forth among pages in a trail as if they were on a single microfilm reel.

In a series of books and articles published from 1964 through 1980, Nelson transposed Bush's concept of automated cross-referencing into the computer context, made it applicable to specific text strings rather than whole pages, generalized it from a local desk-sized machine to a theoretical proprietary worldwide computer network, and advocated the creation of such a network. Though Nelson's Xanadu Corporation was eventually funded by in the 1980s, it never created this proprietary public-access network. Meanwhile, working independently, a team led by (with as chief ) was the first to implement the hyperlink concept for scrolling within a single document (1966), and soon after for connecting between paragraphs within separate documents (1968), with . working with graduate student Dan Ostroff designed and implemented the highlighted link in the in 1983. HyperTIES was used to produce the world's first electronic journal, the July 1988 Communications of ACM, which was cited as the source for the link concept in 's Spring 1989 manifesto for the Web. In 1988, and Greg Kearsley used HyperTIES to publish "Hypertext Hands-On!", the world's first electronic book.

A database program was released in 1987 for the Apple Macintosh that allowed hyperlinking between various pages within a document, as well as to other documents — even separate applications — on the same computer; it was probably the first use of the word "hyperlink". In 1990, , which was introduced with , had widespread use of hyperlinks to link different pages in a single together; in addition, it had a visually different kind of hyperlink that caused a popup help message to appear when clicked, usually to give definitions of terms introduced on the help page. The first widely used open protocol that included hyperlinks from any Internet site to any other Internet site was the from 1991. It was soon eclipsed by HTML after the 1993 release of the (which could handle Gopher links as well as HTML links). HTML's advantage was the ability to mix graphics, text, and hyperlinks, unlike Gopher, which just had menu-structured text and hyperlinks.

In , there is a distinction between the mere act of linking to someone else's website, and linking to content that is illegal (e.g., gambling illegal in the US) or (e.g., illegal MP3 copies). Several courts have found that merely linking to someone else's website, even if by bypassing commercial advertising, is not copyright or trademark infringement, regardless of how much someone else might object. Linking to illegal or infringing content can be sufficiently problematic to give rise to legal liability.
