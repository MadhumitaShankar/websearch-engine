A broad specialization of civil engineering, structural engineering is all about analyzing, planning, designing, and overlooking the construction of large structures like bridges, tunnels, buildings, flyovers, etc. As part of the course, students learn the basic principles of structural analysis which involves examining the strength, stability, and durability of structures.
Typically, a structural engineer specializes in a particular field. It could range from pipeline engineering to bridge engineering and from building engineering to huge air and water structures like aircraft and ships. In India, the demand for structural engineers is high as every construction requires skilled engineers to maintain its durability and quality. A large number of builders, contractors, or architects hire structural engineers as their consultants.
