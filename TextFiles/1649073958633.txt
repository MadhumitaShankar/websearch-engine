Can you suggest some good courses that are available for me to get into NITs or IITs, with a 564 GATE score with an ECE background?

Every year, the maximum GATE 2022 cutoff for admission in NIT goes up to 800-850, the minimum cutoff stands at 350-400. There a score range of 500 to 600 can be considered as a good performance in the GATE exam. You can the list of NITs in which you can get admission for a GATE score of 500 to 600.

Well, the answer is no since 23 marks is very low for getting admission in any top institution.
