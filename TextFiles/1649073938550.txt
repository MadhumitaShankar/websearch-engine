Engineering Colleges in India: Eligibility Criteria & Admission Process
Engineering is a stream of education that involves the application of Science, Technology and Mathematics to innovate, design, develop and maintain machines, structures, software, hardware and systems & processes. This field provides a range of career opportunities across all industries, making it one of the most sought-after courses pursued by students after Class 12, especially those from the Science stream. The BTech programme is your gateway to a career in Engineering with a duration of four years.
Candidates looking forward to pursuing a course must fulfil the requirements laid down by the colleges. Aspirants who meet the eligibility conditions can apply for the course. Check below the common eligibility criteria for admission to BTech colleges in India:

BTech


Candidates must have passed Class 12 with a minimum of 60 per cent aggregate from a recognised board with Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics as core subjects (the pass percentage may vary in different colleges)

Admission is based on merit, written exam, Group Discussion (GD) or Personal Interview (PI) and it varies from college to college
The process of admission is carried out by online counselling where students are allotted seats based on their score/rank in the exam through which the institute offers admission. Some institutes also have additional process of selection which might include group discussion or personal interview.
