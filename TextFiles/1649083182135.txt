It’s lambing season in Snowdonia, but as Covid-19 spreads across the world, Wales is in lockdown. The five farming families are left to film themselves during one of the busiest times of year.
For the farmers of Eryri, spring means the joy of seeing new life arrive on the farms and in the fields. Their flocks of Welsh mountain sheep will all lamb within just a few weeks and many of the cattle are also in calf. It means long hours and lots of hard work for the families.
