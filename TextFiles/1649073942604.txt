Always choose the institute that along with good education provides you a platform to improve your ideas and provide an stage to bring your innovative ideas into practice. As far as these colleges are concern, both are good but I would prefer Lovely Professional University. School of Electronics and Electrical Engineering in LPU provides very good opportunities to all the students of the EE. Placements: LPU has a good placement record for EE students. Every year more than 500+ companies including national and multinational companies visit LPU for placement. A few of them are BOSCH, Microsoft, Code Nation, Adobe, etc. In which students of EEE/ECE are placed. The highest package offered for the M.Tech in EE programme at LPU is 5 LPA.
