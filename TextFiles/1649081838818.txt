Page updated: 18 July 2017



1. First, you need to be signed in. To check if you are, look at the top of this page. If you see “Sign in” next to the BBC logo that means you’re signed out so you don't need to do anything else. (On a mobile it may be under the logo.)
2. Once you're sure you're signed in, click on “Your account” or the display name.
3. On the next page click on “Sign out”. (If you’re on a mobile you’ll need to click on “Menu” first.)
4. It should then say “You’ve signed out, sorry to see you go”.
5. To go back to bbc.co.uk either click on the BBC logo in the top left-hand corner of the page or select “Continue”.
