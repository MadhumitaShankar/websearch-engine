It is an excellent college and worthy in every aspect of engineering.

Placements:
Core companies like Reliance, Bajaj, Birla, etc., offer good opportunities for students to get placed in management and software profiles. 90% of students get placed every year. Merit scholarships are provided for the top students for every branch. Different scholarships are provided, as of my knowledge.

Infrastructure:
The gender ratio here is approximately 2:1. Many clubs and student activities are held every day. Around 20+ clubs are available. Some gender inequality complaints pop up here, but that's not too...

Placements:
NITW has a dedicated placement cell called as training and placement section. In the year 2020-2021, the placements in NITW were decent (very similar to tier 1 college), despite the global pandemic which hit every sector. Due to the pandemic, online and offline placement drives were held. 2020 was my freshman year, so I am not sure about the highest and lowest packages offered, but the average package offered was around 7-8 LPA.

Infrastructure:
Being an institute of national importance, NITW provides all the ess...

As a student very dissatisfied, very less placements. Please read all the points before joining.

Placements:
The placement percentage of the School of Management is very less. Very few students are placed in 2019-2021 batch and many of the students were left unplaced in any company. Even the students who got placements are in startup companies and one MNC company with very less pay package. Most companies don't visit to hire MBA students. The placements stats shown by the placement department are not accurate. Two students quit the course halfway, after studying 1 year and paying semester fees. One stu...

Placements:
Placements are very good, but due to covid, companies are visiting less on the campus. Overall, 53% of the students got placed in our batch of M.Sc. Another aspect of M.Sc is most of the students don't sit for placements as they wish to opt for a PhD. The field where students get a job is the teaching field, and industries hire students with an average salary package of 6 to 7 LPA. Even many faculty members can help you to get a good job in the nearby industries through their reference. Very few...

Good college with nice placement record and the faculty in mechanical are excellent.

Placements:
Around 80% of the candidates gets placed every year, NIT Warangal is very good for placements actually. From the past few years it has been more number of companies are visiting it. In computer science the highest package would be around 40 lacs CTC, whereas in EEE, ECE it would be around more than 30 lacs approximately every year. Regarding Mechanical it is excellent for placements.

Infrastructure:
Regarding the quality and facilities I would give an average rating because it is one of the oldest campus and that too due to some poor maintenance, but for first years the hostel facilities are good, regarding the food, its fine for the Telugu candidates regarding the out of state students, they are most likely to get adjusted with the surroundings. In fact we are having a very fine Wi-Fi enabled campus, which is a great source for students. Classrooms and library excellent for a decent guy to...
