FMS- B-School with the best ROi.

Placements:
The placements are the most attractive part of the campus. It is evident from the past records that most of the profiles ordered are from the marketing field and a very few companies offer Finance profiles to the students of FMS. Therefore, it is called as a marketing campus. Currently interning with Shopclues under Product Development, I am using this opportunity provided by the institution to the best of my learning. The average package for this campus is around 22 Lacs p. a. and with the lowe...

Good summer placements in 2017.

Placements:
100% placement in the summer internships in some of the best companies in the country, across domains and roles has been achieved. For further reports, the placement reports on the FMS website are appropriate and fair. One of the best institutes for marketing, but if you're aiming for consulting or finance, the older IIMs might be a better option.

Infrastructure:
The infrastructure includes the Wi-Fi enabled campus, well-stocked library, and a computer lab. A badminton court with an indoor recreational room with...

Placements:
FMS has a 100% placement record. All the students of our senior batch got placed in reputed companies from India and around the world. There is an equal distribution of job roles in finance and operations domains while sales and marketing roles formed the major chunk of outbound placements. The average salary package offered is about 21 LPA to 22 LPA. Summer placements are organised in a record one and a half days, with almost 100% of the students got placed.

Review of FMS - Faculty of Management Studies, Delhi University.

Placements:
FMS does not lag very much from IIM as its alumni got a salary package of around 15.4 LPA. Placements and companies which visit to recruit students are almost similar in both these institutes. But FMS does not get placement offers by the top strategy consults as IIMs get. However, chances to get placed in top companies and organisations will be on par with the IIM institutes. The batch strength reduces the competition level, so even an academically average student has a high probability of getti...

It is a great college if you want to study.

Placements:
The placements in our college are great, but it varies from person to person. A person can get a great package or the worst. It all depends on the calibre of the person and performance in the interview. You should have a clear understanding of the things you want to achieve, and then, go for it.

Infrastructure:
FMS lacks infrastructure, but this won't stop you from excelling yourself. The fee structure is low, and the infrastructure is very poor. Overall, it lacks good infrastructure needed for any college.

Summer placements for our batch wrapped up in less than two days, in which more than 200 students were placed. The average stipend offered was greater than 1 Lac per month.

Infrastructure:

A college that offers value for money and the time to explore.

Placements:
The summer placements record was 100%, and the average stipend offered was 1 lakh. The highest salary package offered was 2 LPA, and students were offered with roles from all domains. The placement team did a fantastic job of inviting good companies to our campus. Companies such as Morgan Stanley, AT Kearney, BCG, HUL, ITC, and many other reputed brands have visited the campus for placements.

Infrastructure:
Being a small campus with no hostel of its own is a disadvantage, but students can get accommodated at VKRV and can easily avail accommodation in flats nearby the campus. As the college is located in DU, we can get access to other facilities such as university stadium and auditoriums, and it also allows us to participate in competitions that are conducted in other colleges. But having a small campus brings the students closer and allows for better interaction. The canteen is okay, and steps are ...

Placements:
As far as the placements are concerned, the college has fulfilled the expectations of both our batch and our senior batch primarily due to the efficiency of the placement team. Many companies are offering rent roles, thus giving us the element of choice. The roles are offered in marketing, sales, finance, operations and other domains. Due to a large number of companies visiting the campus for placements, almost 100% of the batch got placed.

About FMS Delhi, my B-school

The highest return on investment is just the tip of the iceberg of goodness of FMS.

Placements:
Being in the first year, I was part of the summer placement process whereby placements are conducted for summer internships. The placements were a record success as a lot of new companies visited the campus offering a multitude of roles in marketing, finance, operations, consulting etc. The average stipend offered has increased while the highest stipend offered was 4 lacs.

Infrastructure:
The facilities provided in FMS are limited without any doubt, but it is not a hindrance in any way. All the facilities are available, and you might have to go to the north campus for facilities like a football ground. But, the infrastructure required for education and learning is abundant. FMS boasts of very good performance in sports and cultural events, which in itself is a testimony that there is no lack of facilities. The common belief that FMS lacks in infrastructure is true to an extent, b...

FMS has an unparalleled legacy.

Placements:
Placements of the 2019 batch were on the lines of the same trend of following 100% placement legacy. The pool of talented candidates was placed much before the final day of placements as companies competed among themselves to hire the best minds of the country. Roles offered to students varied from investment banking, consulting, marketing, HR, finance and much more. Almost all the students got internships in reputed companies in their first year. The process was smooth, and candidates were sati...
