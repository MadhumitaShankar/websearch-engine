Love In The Flesh: 'I thought no one would date me with a baby'

As anyone who’s used a dating app knows, modern dating can be tricky.


If you’re a single parent, it can complicate things even more – matching with someone on an app and meeting up becomes less spontaneous as childcare has to be taken into account, and then there’s the question of how to tell someone you’ve got a child.


25-year-old Jess found out first-hand how having a baby changed her approach to dating. As well as the practical considerations, she says that sadly, she’s also had to contend with judgement from some people.


“I thought no one would want to speak to me since having a baby,” she says.


“I had male friends that, if their exes got pregnant they’d be like, ‘I don’t want to speak to her anymore, she’s just had a baby with someone else’. I thought no one would accept me.”


Jess and Kwame first matched online five years ago, but struggled to find time to meet up due to Jess working long shifts as a carer. When both of them met other people, they stopped talking.

Jess and Kwame


'I was scared to tell him I was pregnant'


Jess had her son in 2019, but split with his father before he was born. It was then that she rekindled an online conversation with Kwame after he liked a picture on her Instagram.


Trying to schedule a date was even harder as Jess now had her son to care for around working night shifts.


They finally met in person on new BBC Three dating show Love In The Flesh.


“Me and Kwame were speaking before I fell pregnant,” says Jess.


“Literally a couple of months before I found out I was pregnant, we stopped talking. He had a girlfriend, and I got with my son’s dad. Things didn’t work out so we went our separate ways, then Kwame liked one of my pictures on Instagram.”


After that, the pair started talking again, and Jess worried about how he might react when she told him she was pregnant.


“He mentioned he was single again, and that’s when I told him I was pregnant. I was scared and nervous that he wouldn’t want to speak to me – I am having a baby with someone else. He messaged back saying he’d be there for me.”


Torry, 24, has a one year old son, and has just started using dating apps again. Like Jess, she worried about how she’d be perceived as a single mum.


“There’s so many reasons people might be a single mum – it’s not always just that the father isn’t there,” she says. “It might be that a woman has chosen to no longer be with him. People assume, ‘deadbeat dad, not around, she might get back with the baby’s father…’


“People look down on us. I’m not any less because I’ve had a child. But that was one of my biggest fears going into dating, that people would look at me like I’m less.”


'I’m a parent, but I’m still me'


Torry and her ex were together two and a half years, but having a baby put a strain on the relationship. She decided to leave.


“He is a good father and really involved,” she adds.


While she isn’t seeing anyone at the moment, Torry says she’s had a few encouraging dates where her having a son hasn’t proved an issue for the people she’s met.


“I’m still an independent woman, I work, I do a lot of things for myself that I would have done whether I had my son or not, and there are some guys that see me as a woman and not just a mum,” she says. “There are a lot of men who make you feel bad, but there are some good ones too."








Torry has a young son and has just started dating again


Torry says she’s fortunate to have supportive family and friends who are willing to help with childcare and support her emotionally, too.


“I said to my friends, if I ever sound like I’m losing myself, tell me,” she says. “I said that from when I was pregnant. I’m 24 - I still have a whole life ahead of me, whether I have a child or not.”


For other single parents thinking about dating again, Torry advises them to remember they’re an individual as well as a parent.


“Now you’re a parent, you’re still you. When you go into that dating world, remember that. You’re doing it for you, not your child,” she says. “I don’t expect someone to come in and be a father to my child – they’ve got to fulfil my needs first.”


That said, it’s important any potential partner is willing to welcome your child into their life: “The person who’s right for you will like kids and care about yours.”


'Don’t overlook red flags'


Single mums who participated in a by a researcher at the University of Huddersfield described feeling “isolated, stigmatised, and frustrated with negative stereotypes”.

As the researcher notes, single parent families aren’t uncommon – the latest ONS release on families and households found they make up 15.4% of families in the UK – so you might expect the stigma to have reduced over the years.


According one one relationship expert, though, things haven’t moved on much from when she herself was the daughter of a single parent in the 1980s.


“I can remember my mum – a single mum – dating someone, and I remember him saying he only liked one of us. She had two children! He wanted one of us to live with my dad, and the other to stay with her and him,” says Natalie Lue, who runs the dating advice blog Baggage Reclaim.


Rather than letting online conversations drift on for weeks – or years, in Jess and Kwame’s case – Natalie advises being ready to “flush fast or fail fast” when using dating apps.

“If you’re talking to someone online and they start to make little comments or make you uncomfortable – if you allow these things to persist instead of cutting them off when you first see them, it really starts to erode your self esteem,” she says.


“They might seem little initially. It could be stuff like, ‘oh, I’m taking on someone else’s kid now?’ Don’t even entertain it if you start feeling like you have to justify yourself.”


If you already have anxieties around dating, like Jess, who feared that being a parent would put people off, it’s important not to “let the desire to be with someone overtake your self esteem”, says Natalie.


“If they make a comment and you think, ‘oh, maybe I’m making a big deal out of nothing’, you’re on a slippery slope,” she says. “If someone comes along and says all the right things and woos you, you might be grateful they’re giving you attention and overlook red flags. It’s important to check in with yourself.”


Although meeting someone from a dating app can be anxiety-inducing, even if you’re not a single parent, Natalie advises getting this step out of the way soon after matching, to see if you can be comfortable around the person in real life.


“Meet up sooner rather than later, otherwise you’ll build a picture in your mind of the person,” she says. “You need to then spend enough time around each other that you can be comfortable in yourself.”
