Well first of all lets address you issue. If you need 12lpa then take a drop and again appear for CAT XAT and other exams and SEE if you can improve upon your percentile. Explanation of above sentence is that lots of decent colleges don't accept MAT score so you will eventually struggle to get good college. If your preference is to do MBA then you can go for it given what you get, but it's hard to get 12 LPA at this percentile leave apart the fact that MAT exam will land you to good colleges.
