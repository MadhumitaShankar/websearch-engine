Why aren't all programmes available in HD?




For a programme to be available in HD on BBC iPlayer, it needs to have been broadcast on a BBC HD channel. But in some rare cases, programmes may only be available on BBC iPlayer in SD for rights reasons.
If a programme was broadcast live, it may take longer for the HD version to become available on demand as it can take longer to process. In such cases, please try again later.
