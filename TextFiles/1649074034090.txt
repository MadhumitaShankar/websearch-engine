Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)


Q: Is physiotherapy difficult to study?

A: Physiotherapy is an easy topic to understand. However, one must have a thorough understanding of the subjects/topics. If you understand the fundamentals (as in any other subject), you can simply apply your knowledge to find the answers. The first two years are crucial for laying a solid foundation. The third and fourth years are mostly clinical, with a focus on putting what you've learned so far into practice.


Q: Is physiotherapy a good profession to pursue?

A: For science students who want to work in the medical field, physiotherapy is a lucrative career choice. Physiotherapists' starting pay varies depending on where they work. In this speciality, a good physiotherapist with solid knowledge and experience will earn a good living.


Q: Are physiotherapists in demand?

A: Due to post-Covid recovery needs, ageing and longer working population, population growth, increasing numbers of people with multiple long-term illnesses, and improved survival rates following stroke, trauma, and cancer, there is a raising need for physiotherapy.


Q: B Pharmacy or physiotherapy, which course is better?

A: If you want to study medicine and research drugs, go for B.pharma, and if you want to study physiotherapy, go for this. Choosing a path, as you can see, is entirely dependent on your interests. Both fields are diametrically opposed. A B.Pharma graduate works with drugs and drug research, while a physiotherapist works with patients who have muscular dysfunction. As a result, both careers have a lot of potential in the future.


Q: What subjects are required for physiotherapy?

A: Eligibility Criteria for Physiotherapy Graduation Programs: To qualify for the BPT programme, the aspirant must have completed class 12 with at least 50 per cent of your subjects being Physics, Chemistry, and Biology.


Q: How many types of physiotherapy are there?

A: There are four types of Physiotherapy one should be aware of


Geriatric Physical Therapy.
Sports Physical Therapy.
Orthopaedic Physiotherapy.
Pediatric Physical Therapy.


Q: Is Neet required for BPT?

A: BPT does not require NEET scores. This course is assessed separately by universities or colleges, but some states, such as Maharashtra, can consider neet scores for admission. However, the basic eligibility requirements for admission to BPT are 50 per cent or higher in physics, chemistry, biology, and English in class 12.


Q: Is it possible for a physiotherapist to use a stethoscope?

A: The use of a stethoscope is demonstrated to physiotherapy students. They will teach you simple auscultation techniques such as recording blood pressure zones, breath sounds, and so on.

After 10th you can apply for DPT that is Diploma in physiotherapy. You need to take admission for DPT to become a physiotherapist. But to fully have control over your skill you need to have a degree in BPT that is Bachelor in physiotherapy.

Yes it's the best thing you can do! Before you invest in opening your own centre make sure you have made a mark for yourself among the local people of the area where you are planning to open. My experience says good networking with other people of the field as well as with people related to the field (from orthopedics to technicians )is essential to start your own clinic. 5 years is a long time so I would advise you to go ahead take the plunge! Rest assured if you're honest with your work and good in it you will never regret opening a clinic, instead you will expand it into a hospital too! Along with physiotherapy if you also inculcate a fitness studio (initially just with treadmill, static cycle and ball exercises ) or weight loss programmes you will be more at benefit. Good luck!
