Created over a dozen clean, well referenced articles of notable athletes and kickboxers this year, with over 300 created articles since 2018. No issues now as far as I can tell. () 16:56, 26 March 2022 (UTC)

I'm not sure about this one. There are a lot of notifications about moves to draftspace and subsequent G13 deletions on their user page. And looking at a sample of articles, the prose is not great and there are a lot of citations to Facebook pages and YouTube videos. Also, forgive my ignorance about Thai naming conventions: but are things like , , , and really correctly-romanised names of people?? On the other hand, they seem exclusively interested in Thai kickboxing, which is probably a low-risk topic area. Would appreciate a second opinion on this one, maybe? –? 13:18, 3 April 2022 (UTC)

I've pondered this for a while, . Yes, sourcing might be an issue but this seems to be restricted to participants who were active a long time ago. While article naming appears questionable, I couldn't see any evidence of bios having been moved. Regarding content that's been deleted, the most recent was in September 2021, which was self-nominated by Khonda. Every other deletion is related to content not younger than early 2021. So things seem to have been stable for a good length of time. I've assigned autopatrolled for 6 months and then we can have another look. 21:57, 3 April 2022 (UTC)

At the time I am writing this, I have created 25 articles, all of them using the translation tool to bring articles from the Spanish Wikipedia to the English Wikipedia. Mainly about journalists, TV shows or YouTubers. I would like to get this rank to speed up the work of the reviewers. Thank you. () 17:54, 29 March 2022 (UTC)

I've checked a sample of your articles and they all look good, but since it has been less than a month since you started creating articles and the majority of them have not yet been reviewed, I would prefer to hold off to see what comes out of more thorough review. So for now, but if you are still creating lots of articles in say three months, and nothing else comes up, I would be happy to grant you autopatrolled. Thanks for offering and keep up the good work, –? 11:47, 3 April 2022 (UTC)

Similar to Dandilero above, I don't see any major issues with your articles, but it has only been a couple of months and most of them have not actually been reviewed yet. We generally reserve autopatrolled for "prolific" editors that have been creating articles at a high rate for a significant length of time. but feel free to reapply in three months or so if you still think it would be helpful to have the right. Thank you for your contributions. –? 11:51, 3 April 2022 (UTC)

I've created 26 articles (all of which are still extant) and have been around consistently since 2018. While I'm not an especially prolific contributor, I also create redirects with some regularity, and would like to do my part to reduce the burden on new page reviewers. () 19:36, 31 March 2022 (UTC)

I'm not seeing a convincing need for autopatrolled, given that as you say, you're not an especially prolific creator of articles (26 over a 5 year period). But following EpicPupper's suggestion I've added you to the redirect whitelist. for the bot. –? 13:11, 3 April 2022 (UTC)

Reading about the AutoWikiBrowser, I think it would make my life a lot easier. I do a lot of tedious and repetitive editing to bring pages in line with WikiProject standards. This seems like it would save me an immense amount of time and, well, this may sound silly, but it'll make my left pinky feel a whole lot better too from not having to use it all day for shortcuts like I have been.

One of the main things that I do is work towards making article pages consistent. I focus largely on categories, navboxes, and the infobox itself. One of the things I just finished was all of the missing and then adding them to the player's pages. I've taken an interest in assessing and assigning an importance rating to the vast amount of uncategorized pages for the , which you'll see in my month counts under the edit counter. I also work hard to make sure that when an award is considered appropriate to be listed in the NFL infoboxes, that it consistently is for all those who have received that award. When you go year by year this can end up being quite tedious. I make do with batch editing 20 or so tabs together, throwing pages into a bookmark folder or dragging them to one of my other monitors until I have enough pages to batch edit together. What I'm working on next after this post is resuming my work on adding the accomplishment to pages that are missing it. Having the ability to semi-automate things in a way better than Excel, bookmarks, shortcut keys, and keys on my mouse would be nice. () 12:54, 31 March 2022 (UTC)

, thank you for your patience so far. Unfortunately I have access to the device from Saturday to Friday. All edits were done manually and of course it was my mistake. Because I didn't expect at all that article would be rejected. (In fact, the reputation of this article is well established). Sincerely () 04:04, 4 April 2022 (UTC)

Good day! I am applying for this permission because I think I can execute the responsibility of a new page reviewer. I have experience in rollbacks and I enjoy reverting vandalism, but I also want to learn other sides of Wikipedia. New pages reviewer seems interesting to me as it is a side of Wikipedia that I have rarely seen. I have read the guidelines and according to my own opinion, I am able to do the task as outlined. I have been blocked once for violation more than 6 months ago, and I have promised that I would be more careful in that regard. Thank you very much and have a great day to y'all. 09:45, 16 March 2022 (UTC)

How would you say you have gained that experience? Your AFC contribs look to be maintenance related, you have only a handful of CSDs and little AfD contributions. With your previous declined AFCs, I'm looking for something substantial. -- 02:16, 3 April 2022 (UTC)

I would like to help clear the backlog of unreviewed pages - there are so many disambiguation pages/redirects that are unreviewed and could do with being reviewed to allow other reviewers to find the pages that do need patrolling - I would also like to clear the backlog by accepting pages that have good quality, reliable citations and are notable enough for them to be included in Wikipedia, I would also like to CSD/Draftify (dependent on what the content of the page is) pages that have been created by an overenthusiastic newcomer that does not yet understand how to create a good quality page and I would help them learn how to create a good quality page. I believe that if I put enough effort in I would be able to clear the backlog in a good time period. I would also work hand in hand with the AfC process to speedily review the pages that are accepted in AfC. Thank you for taking the time to review my request for New page reviewer and I hope to be able to clear the backlog if I am granted the permission. | 16:32, 24 March 2022 (UTC)

I'd like to help work on clearing out the backlog of unreviewed pages. I've often found I receive notifications quite a while later after creating redirects or a new navbox. I'm fairly active and would like to start expanding outside of my niche on Wikipedia (American football) and I think this would be a good opportunity for me to do so. In my niche I've worked at trying to revert vandalism, unsourced edits, and have been requesting page protections and adding banners where appropriate. The more I'm exposed to, the more I'll be able to grow and contribute with. Having read the tutorial I'm confident I'll be able to reference that, the flowchart, and the actions of other patrollers to make the right decisions. If I make a mistake, I don't intend on making twice. () 13:09, 29 March 2022 (UTC)

Reason for requesting new page reviewer rights:
I have over 500 mainspace edits and 90 day tenure. I have been active in editing and maintaining articles for over a year. Some of my edits have been minor, but I have many contributions that have spanning medical topics (for example: , , , , ) and more areas.  I have extensive experience with quality control outside of Wikipedia and have created the . Further, I have fleshed out articles that were previously low quality or only stubs (examples: , , ,  ). This is an excellent space for educating others, particularly when it comes to marginalized topics around the world and I could assist others who want to expand on marginalized topics through page creation. After creating and editing some of the above examples, I have learned more about the specific criteria needed and could assist in the endeavour for other new pages.  () 18:00, 3 April 2022 (UTC)

Hi, I am Hcoder3104. I have been a wikipedian for around three years, and have recently became active, jumping from 150 to over 700 edits in two months. I have worked in counter vandalism, however not as often as I would like, due to being unable to really find any. I would like to have these permissions to clear the backlog and work more in counter vandalism. () 16:08, 28 March 2022 (UTC)

Reading your old request and reading the new one - edit count still isn't important. Whether you meet the requirements isn't always important - if you are one edit off rollback requirements but you understand how to use rollback you are more than likely able to get it - the same for PCR - it isn't the edits, it is the experience that matters. | 15:17, 31 March 2022 (UTC)

Hello. I have 1260+ contributions, almost all of them dedicated to patrolling recent changes. I use the Special:recent changes tabs, but mostly SWViewer. I warn users about my rollbacks against their edits, following the correct processes (I'm not going to write all my modus operandi because otherwise my request would be very long, but would be fine checking ). I participate in the administrators's noticeboards to report cases of vandalism. Also, every time I do a bad rollback I rollback to myself, usually typing in the edit summary terms like "Error, I'm sorry", etc., and I've reported by mail to the OS on VRT vandalism with serious content that I must not expose in public. I always have a browser tab open where I monitor that my rollbacks are correct, and I also monitor recent changes and 'hits' (by 'hits' I mean channel bots log when an abuse log is tripped on a page by the users) from the abuse logs on the alongside other users. Last but not least, I'm a veteran , where I've gained a lot of experience with the , so the rollback tool isn't new to me; in any case I've read and am familiar with the policies that involve using the flag.

What gives here, you two? Fastily, I don't think Alabama should have rollback yet, and I have my doubts about Dove too, since reverting a final warning template after a fourth warning template has already been issued isn't really disruptive. Maybe we just have two egos fighting here--none of which helps our encyclopedia. And , why didn't you just go and report that awful person right away after ?

Hello everyone. If I'm not mistaken, the IP continued to vandalize after the 4th warning, added an "Only warning" notice after the 4th warning, which I considered unnecessary and also the IP was already reported (if it was already reported I can't report him too ), so I UNDO Dove's talk, I didn't revert him or her (rather , which doesn't seem appropriate to me, nor does it seem right to bring the topic up here because I haven't used the revert against him/her or .). I don't see anything wrong with them wanting to discuss the issue, but it doesn't seem appropriate here because I only apply the quick revert to vandals (I make mistakes too, but I correct myself).

OK, -Alabama-, "I didn't revert, " (I copied your excessive formatting), that's just--well, it's very wrong. I mean, if you don't understand that "revert" and "undo" are the same thing, well. I mean, they are. And is precisely an abuse of rollback. Your point of view can be very exciting, but from point of view, that of an administrator who's read the rules (for en-wiki; any other wiki's rules are irrelevant), it's not relevant here.

And here is the other thing: you keep talking about the same thing over and over, and what you are missing, and this is what Dove Talk address, while you were fucking around about some warning, some creep was placing disgusting and unacceptable comment on Wikipedia. I don't know if Dove is correct about that glitch in reporting, but it is possible, so I am going to assume that at least Dove tried. You, I don't know what you were doing, but none of it was productive. Your concern shouldn't be for the IP to get the right notice or whatever; your concerns should be (look at the IP's edits) the integrity of the encyclopedia, the rights of living people, and the safety of our editors. Once you understand a. the for rollback and b. the of it, you can ask for it again. () 01:53, 1 April 2022 (UTC)

@: I do know the difference between "undo" and "rollback" (and how each should be used), and apologies for missing the point Dove brought up. I just saw that the 'unique' warning was too much and I removed it, but then the issue got out of hand, and what the IP did was horrible, and I think it's perfect to mention it. I am here for the issue of reversal, I respect and understand the rest. And I don't see why the tool should be taken away from me, if I only use it to combat vandalism anyway, just like Dove, and the others. Greetings, () 02:00, 1 April 2022 (UTC)

I am requesting rollback - mainly because a lot of vandalism slips through the net - with SWViewer it queues what it believes to be vandalism which results in less false positives than patrolling recent changes with filters. With Huggle - you get access to the Huggle Antivandalism Network which would coordinate my attempts to revert vandalism with other Huggle Users and ClueBot NG.

Said request was 2 months ago - I believe that since then - I have become a better editor and have become a better vandalism fighter. | 15:28, 31 March 2022 (UTC)

I had requested this right previously () on 15 Dec 2021 and my request was rejected as I didn't need rollback much at that point of time. Since then, especially in 2022, I've started to significantly use Twinkle's rollback and restore version tools along with generic undo and revert pending changes options, and believe that rollbacker right will help me with such tasks, and thus I'm re-requesting this right. Thanks! 18:23, 3 April 2022 (UTC)
