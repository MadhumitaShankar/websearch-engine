UCEED 2022 exam preparation: Last-minute tips

Candidates appearing in the UCEED 2022 exam only have a few hours left to give the finishing touches to their exam preparation. While the preparation you have done until now is invaluable, these last few hours can make a big difference to your score. Here are some tips to maximize scoring chances by following these tips.


Don't start any new topics now - Because it is too late already to try out new things. Instead, use the time to prepare for already studies topics

Practice mock tests and solve sample papers - When solving sample papers, don't keep repeating the same questions. Mix and match. The idea is to broaden your problem-solving skills and test out all the concepts. Mock tests also serve a similar purpose to sample papers, but also give you an exam-like ambiance and help you learn time management.

Quickly go through the notes and important points - You must be maintaining notes of the important points; go through them. Also, if you marked tricky points, areas in your textbooks, revisit those points at least once.

Stay healthy and dehydrated - You need to be in prime health of exam day; only then your brain, mind, and body will respond the way you want them to. So sleep for at least 7-8 hours, drink enough water, eat light and healthy food, and keep a positive mindset. Don't think too far ahead to keep pressure at bay.

The following are good institutes that consider the UCEED exam for eligibility in admission: Indian Institute of Technology. Mumbai. Indian Institute of Technology. Hyderabad. Lovely Professional University. Jalandhar. Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology. Delhi. PDPM Indian Institute of Information Technology, Design, and Manufacturing. Jabalpur. Being an alumnus of LPU, I would like to tell you that LPU is accepting the UCEED exam for the design programmes offered by LPU such as fashion design, multimedia, game design, etc. My friend completed B. Design (Fashion) from LPU. I will be sharing a few major highlights of the Fashion Design course based upon her experience. LPU School of Fashion has been ranked 6th best Institute in India and 1st in Punjab The School of Fashion Designing of Lovely Professional University is doing extraordinary works in the field of Designing. They are conducting Fashion Shows regularly for the students. It gives a great chance to the students to show their talent in front of a big audience. Prominent designers are also taking part in the events. So, surely it is a big opportunity university is providing to the students in LPU. The infrastructure for the practical works is very excellent in the university. Students can enjoy the course curriculum which has given more importance to practical knowledge. Scholarships have one other significance. Students can avail scholarships based on their score in the qualifying exam or according to their performance in the University test. The highest package offered for these programmes at LPU is INR 5 LPA and the average package is INR 3.1 LPA. Companies visited for the placement at LPU are SOCKSOHO, IKARUS 3D, AMPLE, SAMARTH LIFESTYLE, WORLD FASHION EXCHANGE, INDITEX TRENT RETAIL INDIA PVT LTD, RELIANCE BRANDS, DA MILANO LEATHERS PVT. LTD. , PVH ARVIND FASHION PVT. LTD. (CALVIN KLEIN &amp; TOMMY HILFIGER), and many more. Anyhow you can enjoy the campus and course here and can excel in the field once you are completing the course. I hope this helps.

1098 is a pretty good score in UCEED. Use Shiksha college predictor to know which college he gets in and have a chance of getting into specific college.

Hello Manu Kataria, firstly I must congratulate your son for getting such an excellent ranking. I would suggest that you download the college predictor for UCEED. Once you download, start putting in ranking of your son and you will get fairly accurate guess about place where he can get admission....
