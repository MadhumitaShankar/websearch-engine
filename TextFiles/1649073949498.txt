Hello Karan R Gaurav, if you are in second year of three year degree course of A.M.E. I would strongly advise you to concentrate on studies. You can perhaps think of internship during college holidays if your college can organise the same. After this course, you need clear licence exam conducted by DGCA. So you need to be thorough in studies. Best wishes to you.

Aircraft maintenance engineering is not a degree or a Diploma course, but a training programme. On completion of the training, a license is issued by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA). And it should not be considered a valid graduation degree.
