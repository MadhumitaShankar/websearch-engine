Based on previous year's cut-offs you have very less chances of getting Government B.A. MS seat or BHMS seat but you try for Management seat/ Paid seat in Priavte B.A. MS Colleges based on this year cutoffs atleast in Mop-up round. For government atleast you have to score 500.

Chiropractic being a specialised professional course requires many years of study and rigorous training for hours. To pursue Chiropractic course, the aspirant must have completed a Bachelor degree from a recognised university. A candidate can pursue chiropractic course either through a five year integrated programme which combines three years undergraduate programme and two years post-graduate programme, or a doctoral programme of four years duration. However, to enrol for Chiropractic course, the students must have completed their Class twelve board examination with Physics Chemistry and Biology.
