Mel Gibson's Oscar-winning epic about William Wallace's rebellion against Edward I.

Show more

In the 14th century, Scotland is choking under the iron rule of England's tyrannical king, Edward Longshanks. Only one man is prepared to risk everything to stem the English tide: William Wallace, fiery rebel and hero of the common man, driven by a passionate grief for his murdered wife and the undying belief in the freedom of his beloved country.
