WP:ENFORCEMENT


WP:ENFORCE
Enforcement on Wikipedia is similar to other social interactions. If an editor violates the community standards described in policies and guidelines, other editors can persuade the person to adhere to , over time resorting to more forceful means, such as and actions. In the case of gross violations of community norms, they are likely to resort to more forceful means fairly rapidly. Going against the principles set out on these pages, particularly policy pages, is unlikely to prove acceptable, although it may be possible to convince fellow editors . This means individual editors (including ) enforce and apply policies and guidelines.

Wikipedia:Avoid instruction creep
Policy and guideline pages should:

. Avoid esoteric or quasi-legal terms or dumbed-down language. Be plain, direct, unambiguous, and specific. Avoid platitudes and generalities. Even in guidelines, help pages, and other non-policy pages, do not be afraid to tell editors directly they or do something.
Be clear
must
should
Verbosity is not a reliable defense against misinterpretation. Omit needless words. Direct, concise writing may be clearer than rambling examples. Footnotes and links to other pages may be used for further clarification.
Be as concise as possible—but no more concise.
Expect editors to use common sense. If the spirit of the rule is clear, say no more.
Emphasize the spirit of the rule.
Clearly identify the purpose and scope early in the page, as many readers will just look at the beginning. Content should be within the scope of its policy. When the scope of one advice page overlaps with the scope of another, minimize redundancy. When one policy refers to another policy, it should do so briefly, clearly and explicitly.
Maintain scope and avoid redundancy.
Links to policies, guidelines, essays, and articles should be used only when clarification or context is needed. Links to other advice pages may inadvertently or intentionally defer authority to them. Make it clear when links defer, and when they do not.
Avoid overlinking.
The community's view cannot simultaneously be "A" and "not A". When apparent discrepancies arise between pages, editors at all the affected pages should discuss how they can most accurately represent the community's current position and correct all the pages to reflect the community's view. This discussion should be on talk page, with invitations to that page at the talk pages of the various affected pages; otherwise the corrections may still contradict each other.
Not contradict each other.

Life cycle









Shortcut



WP:PGLIFE
Many of the most well-established policies and guidelines have developed from principles which have been accepted as fundamental since Wikipedia's inception. Others developed as solutions to common problems and disruptive editing. Policy and guideline pages are seldom established without precedent and always require strong community support. Policies and guidelines may be established through new proposals, promotion of existing essays or guidelines, and reorganization of existing policies and guidelines through splitting and merging.

[3]
Essays and information pages may be established by writing them and adding {{}}, {{}}, {{}}, or to the page.

Proposals for new guidelines and policies require discussion and a from the entire community for promotion to guideline or policy. Adding the {{}} template to a page without the required consensus does not mean the page is policy, even if the page summarizes or copies policy. Most commonly, a new policy or guideline documents existing practices, rather than proposing a change to what experienced editors already choose to do.

Good practice for proposals


One path for proposals is developing them through steps of

{{}}
brainstorming
{{}}
draft proposal
{{}}
proposal
{{}} or {{}}
policy
guideline
The first step is to write the best initial proposal you can. Authors can request early-stage feedback at and from any relevant WikiProjects. Amendments to a proposal can be discussed on its talk page. It is crucial to improve a proposal in response to feedback received from outside editors. Consensus is built through a process of listening to and discussing the proposal with many other editors.
Wikipedia's village pump for idea incubation
Once you think the initial proposal is well written, and the issues involved have been sufficiently discussed among early participants to create a proposal that has a solid chance of success with the broader community, start a (RfC) about your policy or guideline proposal in a new section at (VPPOL), or on the proposal's talk page and advertised with a notice at VPPOL. Include the tag, along with a brief, time-stamped explanation of the proposal. Then, if you want, you can provide a detailed explanation of what the page does and why you think it should be a policy or guideline. The {{}} template should be placed at the top of the proposed page; this tag will get the proposal properly categorized.

WP:Village Pump/Policy
{{|policy}}
rfc
Proposal
The RfC should typically be announced at the and/or village pumps, and you should notify other potentially interested groups. If your proposal affects a specific content area, then related WikiProjects can be found at the . If your proposal relates to an existing policy or guideline, then leave a note on the talk page of the related policy or guideline. For example, proposed style guidelines should be announced at , which is the main guideline for style issues. Try to identify the subcategory of guideline or policy (see {{}} template). Proposals involving contentious subjects or wide-ranging effects should normally be listed on for the duration of the RfC. Rarely, a particularly important proposal may be advertised via a ; sitenotices (which are displayed to all readers, not just to active editors) are not used for proposals. RfCs for policy and guideline proposals are normally left open for at least a week or sometimes a couple months.

watchlist notice
To avoid later complaints about insufficient notice, it may be helpful to provide a complete list of the groups or pages you used to advertise the proposal on the talk page. Be careful not to , and avoid non-neutral wording.
canvass
Editors should respond to proposals in a way that helps identify and build consensus. Explain your thoughts, ask questions, and raise concerns. Many editors begin their responses with bold-font 'vote' of support or opposition to make evaluation easier.
Closing a discussion requires careful evaluation of the responses to determine the consensus. This does not require the intervention of an administrator; it may be done by any sufficiently experienced impartial editor, not involved in the discussion, who is familiar with all policies and guidelines related to the proposal. The following points are important in evaluating consensus:

for guidelines and policies should be reasonably strong, though unanimity is not required.
Consensus
There must be exposure to the community beyond just the authors of the proposal.
Consider the strength of the proposed page:

Have major concerns raised during the community discussion been addressed?
Does the proposal contradict any existing guidelines or policies?
Can the new proposed guideline or policy be merged into an existing one?
Is the proposed guideline or policy, or some part of it, redundant with an existing guideline or policy?
A proposal's status is not determined by counting votes. , nor is a poll's numerical outcome tantamount to consensus.
Polling is not a substitute for discussion
If consensus for broad community support has not developed after a reasonable time, the proposal has failed. If consensus is neutral or unclear on the issue and unlikely to improve, the proposal has likewise failed.

Discussion may be closed as one of: , , or . Please leave a short note about the conclusion you came to. Update the proposal to reflect the consensus. Remove the {{}} template and replace it with another appropriate template, such as {{}}, {{}}, {{}}, {{}}, or {{}}. See for a listing of banners.

If a proposal fails, the failed tag should not usually be removed. It is typically more productive to rewrite a failed proposal from scratch to address problems, or seek consensus to integrate uncontroversial aspects of it into existing pages, than to re-nominate a proposal.

The process for demotion is similar to promotion. A talk page discussion is typically started, the template is added to the top of the project page, and community input is solicited. After a reasonable amount of time for comments, an independent editor should close the discussion and evaluate the discussion and determine whether a consensus has formed to change the status.

The {{}} template is typically used instead of {{}} for claims that a page was recently assigned guideline or policy status without proper or sufficient consensus being established.

Under discussion
Essays, information pages, and other informal pages that are supported by only a small minority of the community are typically moved to the primary author's userspace. These discussions typically happen on the page's talk page, sometimes with an RfC, but they have at times also been conducted at (despite the MFD guidelines explicitly discouraging this practice). Other pages are retained for historical reference and are marked as such.

Content changes

WP:PGCHANGE

See also:
Wikipedia:Policy writing is hard
Policies and guidelines can be edited like any other Wikipedia page. It is not strictly necessary to discuss changes or to obtain written documentation of a consensus in advance. However, because policies and guidelines are sensitive and complex, users should take care over any edits, to be sure they are faithfully reflecting the community's view and to be sure they are not accidentally introducing new sources of error or confusion.
Keep in mind that the purpose of policies and guidelines is to state what most Wikipedians agree upon, and should be phrased to reflect the present on a subject. Editing a policy/guideline/essay page does not in itself imply an immediate change to accepted practice. It is, naturally, bad practice to recommend a rejected practice on a policy or guideline page.
consensus
As explained below, you may update best practices by editing boldly or by working toward widespread consensus for your change through discussion.

Substantive changes



Further information:
Wikipedia:Be bold § Wikipedia namespace
Before making substantive changes to policy and guideline pages, it is sometimes useful to try to establish a reasonable exception to the existing practice. To try to update the existing best practices this way, you may directly deviate from the established practice following the and principles and make the change to pages. After some time, if there's no objections to the change and/or if a widespread consensus for your change or implementation is reached through discussion, you can then edit policy and guideline pages describing the practice to reflect the new situation.

WP:TALKFIRST
Talk page discussion typically precedes substantive changes to policy. Changes may be made if there are no objections or if discussion shows there is consensus for the change. Minor edits to improve formatting, grammar, and clarity may be made at any time.
Talk first.
If the result of discussions is unclear, then it should be evaluated by an administrator or other independent editor, as in the proposal process. Major changes should also be publicized to the community in general; announcements similar to the proposal process may be appropriate.
If wider input on a proposed change is desired, it may be useful to mark the section with the tag . (If the proposal relates to a single statement, use immediately after it.)

Conflicts between advice pages







Shortcut



WP:POLCON

See also:
Wikipedia:Content forking/Internal § Policy forks
If policy and/or guideline pages directly conflict, one or more pages need to be revised to resolve the conflict so all the conflicting pages accurately reflect the community's actual practices and best advice. As a temporary measure during that resolution process, if a guideline appears to conflict with a policy, editors may assume the policy takes precedence.
More commonly, advice pages do not directly conflict, but provide multiple options. For example, says newspaper articles are generally considered to be reliable sources, and recommends against newspaper articles for certain technical purposes. Editors must use their best judgement to decide which advice is most appropriate and relevant to the specific situation at hand.
