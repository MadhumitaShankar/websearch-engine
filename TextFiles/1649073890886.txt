Excellent and one of the best B-schools in country.

Placements:
The placements are excellent in our college. This is a B-school where top companies of the country visit to hire students. The placement percentage is 100%.

MDI is great and definitely a worthy choice.

Placements:
Placements have been good for both my batch and the seniors with 100% placements. As this is one of the top B-schools of the country, well-known companies come to give sought-after roles in finance (investment banking, private equity, etc.), sales and marketing (FMCG sales and marketing roles). The placement cell works tirelessly and is very efficient. The details of placement can be looked for in MDI's website under placements section. The average package is trending towards 20 lacs per annum f...

The college has some superb professors for marketing and finance. The placements are 100% and the placement report is easily available for all to look. Apart from all this, the location advantage is that being in Gurgaon helps students work on multiple live projects from the industry.
