Delighted to be here because of the faculty and curriculum.

Placements:
So I'm still in my first year but hearing from the seniors that placements are almost 100% for summers. There are diversified profiles here and people get placed into different sectors. All the top consult, finance and marketing (FMCG) firms visit our college.

Infrastructure:
Faculty in IIM B is around 109 and they are highly qualified with most of them holding one or two Ph.D. degrees. We have Wi-Fi access across the campus and classrooms are with CCTVs and projectors. We have one mess for the students which ac...

Review of IIM, Bangalore.

Placements:
The placement rate of IIMB has been pegging at 100% for many years now. The lateral and final placements for PGP class of 2016-18 saw 420 students receiving offers from 140+ companies, in India and abroad, across sectors. Similar was the case for summer placements of PGP 2017-19 batch, which I was a part of. Though I don't have ascertained information on absolute highest and lowest placement figures, the average has been consistently pegging at 20 LPA-22 LPA for the last couple of years. The off...

Beautiful campus and nice crowd.

Placements:
Placements are really good. All the students get placed in very short time. Most big companies come for recruitment during summer placement and also for final placement. There are some international offers as well. Companies during summer placement and final placement are almost same.

Infrastructure:
IIM Bangalore has 100 acre large beautiful campus. All the students are provided hostel facilities. Everyone is given single room with shared washrooms. Campus is Wi-Fi enabled. Mess food is very good if you compar...

Absolute value for money. Every student can have holistic learning.

Placements:
Placements are excellent. 100% placement happens in IIM Bangalore. More than 120 companies participate in campus placement including BCG, Brain, ABG, Nestle, P&G and many others. The highest package goes above 30 LPA, the lowest revolves around 15 LPA and the median is around 23 LPA. In summer placement, 100% of students from PGP1 gets internship though this year due to COVID, there were some hiccups but those were manageable.

Value for Money 5





The good: Some of the best minds get into this campus and, therefore, the learning from your own peer group gives a stiff competition to the classroom learning. Most classes are interactive in nature with a balanced mix of the case based and theoretical pedagogy. There is also a great mix of extracurriculars ranging from volunteering work to cult fests to so parties. Alum network is fairly decent and the placements are one of the best in an Indian B-school. Being in Bangalore, this campus enjoy...

The place to be, if you want to be.

Placements:
The placements were excellent, almost 100% unless you chose to opt out. The salary details may be found on the IIMB website www.iimb.ernet.in. The list of recruiters and the roles offered can also be found on the website and is publicly available. However, my view is that placements should not be the main criteria. "Kaabil" bano, develop a strong core competency in your time at IIM-B. You will easily get a job.

Infrastructure:
There is good Wi-Fi connectivity throughout the campus. Quality of classes is top notc...

IIM, Bangalore is the place to be.

Placements:
The placements (summer placements for PGP 2017-19) at IIM, Bangalore were good in general. All the students were placed within 2.5 days. The companies came from a variety of sectors. IIMB saw some first-time recruiters as well as the companies who took a gap last year. The list of companies can be found here on the website www dot iimb.ac. dot in/recruiters/whyrecruit (hyphen) iimb/our-recruiters. For a more detailed report on summer placements, please refer to the following report by IIM Bangal...

IIM Bangalore - place to business.

Placements:
The summer placements give the students a wide range of companies to choose and experiment type, so that they know in which field they would like to choose by the time of their final year placements come. For the process itself, a lot of help and guidance is given by the seniors and faculty, to ensure that you are ready to face the interviews and also the job.

MBA is a course where you learn not only from the course curriculum but also from fellow students, club activities, alumni interactions, corporate presentations, guest lectures, student exchange programs and sports events. Having studied at IIMB, I can vouch that the school guarantees an excellent mix of these ingredients and hence is possibly one of the best B-schools in the country. The campus, though situated in the city, is calm and serene and provides an excellent atmosphere for learning an...

1) Courses : Diverse range of academic courses ranging from social media analysis to African policy development. After 1st trimester, the student will get a wide variety of choices to select subjects. Availability will, of course, depend on supply-demand economics. 2) Learning: Though mainly focused on traditional paper-based exams; real learning happens through case study solving with peers. Hence, having a good peer network is very important. The faculty is top class & always open to help, pro...

An amazing combination of everything!

Placements:
The placement scenario is amazing. I haven't seen a more efficient process for placements. Everyone has a choice of picking up good companies. The highest salary was around 75 LPA, and the lowest CTC was around 14 LPA. The companies which visit the campus range from consulting firms, global investment banks, e-commerce to FMCG and upcoming start-ups. 100% folks get internships. The highest package would be around 5 lacs/month and the lowest around 50k/month.

Best among all the MBA Colleges across India.

Placements:

Mostly, students are recruited by consulting, marketing and finance firms. Several start-ups conducted campus placements for the first time. There were ample opportunities for the students. All the students were placed during summer internships and final placements.

The faculty is very good. The teachers are highly qualified and the class teaching is better than any notes. The libraries are excellent with each and every journal we could have.

Absolutely satisfied with the college. Two years of the course duration was worthy.

Placements:
The placements conducted in our college were too good, mainly the summer placements. 120+ PPO offers were rolled out. Many students got placed in lateral placements as well. The final placements were average as per IIMB standards, but it was easy to get more than 15 LPA. The average package offered was around 20 LPA to 21 LPA, and the lowest package offered was around 12 LPA to 13 LPA. The highest package offered was around 40 LPA in India. Some investment banks offered 35-36 LPA on an average. ...

Great Faculty, Beautiful campus

Placements:
The placements for our senior batch were good. Almost 97% of the batch was placed.The highest salary was around 12 Lakh per anum.During our batch the plavcements took a hit. This was mainly because of the state bifurcation strikes happening during our final year. Since it is a government college it had a huge effect.The average package should be around 5 lakhs per anum. Only 70% students were placed. But for the next batches placements were good again. So that was just because of the uncertain...
