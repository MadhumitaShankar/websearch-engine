Do I need to focus on DU LLB Exam in 12th? Should I start preparing for DU LL.B. Exam? I am currently in 12th.

No, now it is not necessary because DU LL.B. HONS is after graduation. So you should focus on class 12th first. If then also you have time so first start preparing for entrance of graduation of University you will be going. I think this is enough for you to understand.
