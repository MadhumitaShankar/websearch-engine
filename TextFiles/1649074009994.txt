This is the best college that I could get. NIT Trichy provides the best placements.

Placements:
Currently, I am in 2nd year, so we have no placements yet. But as per my seniors, 80-90% of students get placed in different domains. Companies like L&T, Cantilever, PSUs, etc., come for placements. The highest package offered was 17 LPA, and the lowest package was 6 LPA. 15-30% of students got internships.

Infrastructure:
As our batch never visited the campus, it's difficult to tell about the infrastructure. However, as per seniors, we have 27 hostels and 6 mess facilities related to different parts of India. E...

Here M.Sc. in Computer Science course is completely placement oriented, in my view.

Placements:
Almost 100% of the students from our course got placed. The highest salary package offered is 28.9 LPA, and the lowest salary package offered is 5 LPA. Top recruiting companies like SAP Labs, Micron, Citicorp, Cerner, Atyati Technologies, FICO, etc., visit our campus for placements. None of the students from our course got an internship this year. Roles like software developer, software engineer, data scientist, data engineer and data analyst are offered to the students.

Infrastructure:
Our college provides a 24x7 high-speed Wi-Fi facility in hostels and labs. There is 24x7 access to the cyber library. We can access the central library from 7 AM to 9 PM. There is 24x7 availability of health centre. There are different messes for north Indian and south Indian students. However, North Indians can choose south Indian mess. There are different messes for vegetarian and non-vegetarian students. There are separate messes for both boys and girls. Girls cannot enter in boys hostel. An ...

It has the top placements in India, a loving faculty and a generous environment. No regret.

Placements:
Almost, there will be 100 percent placements for those who applied for it. Many people went for higher studies, and some went to research. A maximum of 2 to 3 people failed to get a decent job. Internships here are comparable to old IITs and also for the scenario of placement, no one regrets joining NIT-Trichy instead of IITs.

Infrastructure:
The college has an 800+ acre of campus, I.e. 3 times bigger than IIT-Delhi or Bombay. Of course, the buildings are well furnished, and hostel buildings are old. Many new b...

Placements are very good at NIT Trichy if you are from circuit branches like CSE, ECE and EEE. The mechanical department also gets good placements, but not very much as circuit branches. However, we have opportunities to explore and apply to many different fields. So, there's a good peer group. Almost 85% of students get placed, while others opt for higher studies.

In the first year, you have to adjust in the hostel as 3 students are allotted to one room or 2 students per room, depending on the h...

The labs and classrooms are decently maintained and equipped with the necessaries. We have an Apollo medical centre on our campus for immediate medical attention, but for our serious, we have to go to some other nearby hospitals. The sports facilities are really good, and we even get a decent number of medals from various competitions.

Honestly, if a student is admitted here, he doesn't need to worry about jobs but needs to worry about how better the job is according to his parameters. There are the sectors which visit our campus. They are Software, IT, management and core companies. There are good packages in all the three sectors depending on how good you are in your skills. Few students also opt for furth...
