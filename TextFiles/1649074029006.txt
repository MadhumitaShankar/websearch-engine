Q. How to know the authenticity of an MBBS course in India?
A. Before taking admission to any medical college, check whether the college is recognised by the Medical Council of India (MCI). Also, check if the college/ university is approved by the University Grants Commission (UGC) and Indian Medical Council (IMC).

A. Yes, to join an MBBS course you need to complete 10+2 with Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and English. You must also secure a minimum aggregate of 50 per cent in the core subjects (PCB).

Q. Can we join MBBS without NEET?
A. No, to join the MBBS course you need to write the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET). Even if you want to opt for a management quota seat, you have to secure the qualifying percentile in NEET.

Q. Which university is best for MBBS in India?
A. There are a lot of good universities for an MBBS course in India. However, the best of the lot is AIIMS Delhi. A few other top institutes for the MBBS course include AFMC, CMC (Vellore), Maulana Azad Medical College and Lady Hardinge Medical College.

Q. What are the fees for MBBS in India?
A. Fees for an MBBS degree course vary for the institutes of different categories. Fee in a government college ranges between Rs 10,000 - Rs 50,000, whereas a private medical college, can charge fees ranging from Rs 2,00,000 and can go up to Rs 22,00,000.

Q. What is the total duration of MBBS degree course?
A. To complete MBBS degree course, you need to finish two stages: 4.5 years of academics and 1 year of internship. Hence, the total duration of an MBBS degree course is 5.5 years.

Q. Can one use "Dr" after completing MBBS?
