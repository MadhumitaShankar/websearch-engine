What happens to your comments

We read all comments in full along with all the other reaction we receive. If you call, we’ll summarise your points with you and then note them down.
We then collate and classify all the reaction we’ve had overnight so we can circulate it the next morning to producers and managers to read and consider. In order to help us do this, we ask you to complete some details when you fill in our webform.
We can’t reply to or acknowledge all comments but do read them all. All the comments, appreciations and any other reaction we receive are considered alongside audience research. They inform our discussions about existing or new programmes, coverage and services.
