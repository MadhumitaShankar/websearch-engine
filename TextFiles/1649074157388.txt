According to the recent NIRF ranking 2021, LPU is ranked 62nd among all government and Private universities in India. Strong academia-industry connection:-With a plenty of study opportunities, LPU provide students with global excellence and industry immersion. This university has collaborated with the top-notch brands such as Google, Cisco, Oracle, SAP, Microsoft and many more to have its center of excellence, students from south get numerous chances to work directly with the companies on live projects to get a practical exposure. This helps the students to get an insight about the recent trends of the industries. There are hardly any university or college in south having such a exposure and deep collaboration. Unbeatable Placement Records is Now a Habit:-LPU has one of the best placement records in the whole of India and that is why students want to join LPU to get placed. Right from Google to Microsoft, LPU alumni are working with the top brands at the package of 1 crore and above. Annually, more than 450 brands come to LPU to recruit the students, where 90% of them are MNCs. Moreover, 80+ companies that recruit from IITs and NITs also recruit from LPU. Over the last three years, Cognizant alone has recruited 1900+ students from LPU campus and has been titled with the Most Employable Students consecutively twice in a row by the India's top talent company Aspiring Minds. Barring few names in south, there are hardly any college which can boast of such tall records.

BA LLB covers the subjects of humanities, while BBA LLB includes management and business studies subjects. The subjects of law are the same in both the programmes. However, the career opportunities after completing both these courses remain the same. The basic difference between the BA LLB (Hons. ) and BA LLB degree is that BA LLB (Hons. ) provides comprehensive knowledge of each law subject from the syllabus whereas BA LLB degree only offers general knowledge or outline of the law subjects. So prefer to do the integrated law Hons. degree.
