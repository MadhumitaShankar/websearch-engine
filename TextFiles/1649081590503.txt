What are the rules for commenting and uploading?
Page updated: 31 January 2022



We love you posting comments and uploading creations. But please don’t do anything horrible, rude or illegal.
More specifically, please don’t post or upload anything that:

Is inappropriate (abusive, offensive or disruptive – NB: we have a zero-tolerance approach to user-to-user personal abuse)
Is off topic (to the original content or the current conversation. This includes commenting for the purpose of derailing the conversation with the intention of discussing another topic)
Contains personal information (either your own or someone else’s)
Puts children at risk
Is illegal, or glamorises illegal activity
Is potentially harmful misinformation or disinformation
Is defamatory (damaging to someone else’s reputation)
Is in contempt of court (anything that could affect the outcome of a court case)
Infringes anyone’s rights (including privacy rights)
Was made by someone else, or that copies someone else’s creation
Is posted for your financial gain (advertising, sponsorship etc.)
Isn’t in English (unless we’ve asked you to comment in another language - Welsh and Gaelic are currently not supported)
Contains spam (unless you’re commenting on a story about reconstituted meat)
Contains links to content that requires a log in, leads to a download or may otherwise be unsafe (viruses, spyware, paywalls etc.)
Breaks our election and referendum rules (No campaigning, no sloganeering, no polling, no encouraging others to vote a certain way and no mentions of who you voted for on election day itself)
Or doesn’t comply with the rest of our Terms of Use
