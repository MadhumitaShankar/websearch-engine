Advertising



[
edit
]

To cover server costs, or for some other public good such as charity, Wikipedia should add advertisements to its pages. The ads could be highly targeted, unobtrusive textual ads similar to those used by Google. Revenues would be very high based on Wikipedia's very high search engine ranking for many diverse keywords.
Proposal:
Wikipedia is supposed to be , which advertising by definition is not. Even if well segregated from article content, advertising could create an impression that our content is commercially influenced and that our content could be affected by advertisers threatening to withdraw their ads, whether or not this is actually the case. Advertising could discourage contributors, the lifeblood of Wikipedia, many of whom object strongly to advertising. Placing ads would also likely decrease the amount of money raised by community fundraising. Also, since we don't allow spam or advertising by users, doing it ourselves would be, at the very least, hypocritical. Finally, the financial situation of the Wikimedia Foundation, which hosts the website, is stable—there is no pressing need to make such a change.

Only allow the truth in articles



[
edit
]

For a long time, the first sentence of stated, "The threshold for inclusion is verifiability, not truth". This meant that the absolute minimum standard for including material in Wikipedia is that it be possible to verify it; the minimum standard for including material is merely being true in the opinion of an editor. The most common proposal is to require not only that all material be verifiable, but that all material also be true in the opinion of editors. The second most common proposal is to require that material be verifiable . It is usually motivated by a desire to reduce errors in Wikipedia or increase Wikipedia's scholarly reputation.
Proposal:
Wikipedia:Verifiability
not
either
or
true according to any editor
Wikipedia is supposed to be based on reliable sources, not on the opinions or beliefs of editors. The community refuses to let editors delete well-sourced material if they believe the sources are wrong or to include material merely because they personally believe the unpublished, unsourceable material to be true. Adding unsourced material or deleting well-sourced material on the basis of editors' personal beliefs can result in biased, unbalanced articles and frequently does result in between editors with opposing personal beliefs.

Proposal:
verification
Wikipedia:Reliable sources
guideline
official policy
Wikipedia:Verifiability
Wikipedia:No original research
Assessing the reliability of sources requires sound editorial judgment, not strict adherence to a list of rules. Whether a source is reliable depends on how the source relates to the material: a very weak source may be reliable for a very small claim, such as "this source was published", while a very strong source will be deemed unreliable if the claim is unrelated to the source's contents (e.g., a source about electricity being cited for information about a celebrity). Although it may be possible to define a minimum threshold below which sources are never acceptable as reference for Wikipedia content, it appears presumptuous to define all sources that threshold as "reliable". For this reason, a universally applicable (or: -level) definition of reliable sources is impractical. Furthermore, strict rules about what type of source is permitted amount to .

WP:FUTON

Editors should use sources that anyone can read immediately, without cost.
Proposal:
Editors should use the best sources available to them, regardless of cost or format. The content policies require that it be possible for someone to verify a given statement—not that it be quick, easy, and free for you to verify it. A "replacement" source that is available online and/or without cost is not identical to the first source, and therefore is never truly equal in all particulars. Many academic journals eventually release papers, and more books are being digitized, so "unavailable" sources may become freely available later. What appears to be free in your country or computer network may not be free everywhere. Wikipedia already has a systemic bias in favor of freely available online sources (called the ) that are written in ; this bias may distort its contents, and institutionalizing such a recommendation would only further exacerbate this bias.

Move maintenance tags to talk pages



[
edit

Proposal
cleanup
POV
self-references to Wikipedia
Every reader is a potential editor and the maintenance tags give potential editors ideas of how to improve an article. Some tags also serve as warnings to readers about potentially problematic and low-quality content. The {{}} "meta-template" used by the templates means that they are not nearly as cluttered-looking as they were before 2007. The implementation costs would be large: About a million articles have maintenance tags, and moving them all to talk pages would be a massive undertaking, even using a bot or spreading the work out over many months. The documentation on all the templates, several editing help pages, and any bot or script that edits or reads maintenance tags would have to be updated manually.

Changes to standard appendices



[

The standard appendices at the end of an article (e.g., and ) should be changed to the system preferred by the editor/a particular professional field/the editor's school. These proposals may involve changing the names of the sections (e.g., changing to or ), changing the order of the sections (e.g., putting first, or last), or changing the formatting (e.g., long lists of references should be hidden in a scrolling box).
Proposal:

External links
References

External links
References
Policies and guidelines document "actual good practices". Most proposals fail to demonstrate that their proposed practice is an emerging, sustainable alternative to the current method. These guidelines only seek to document the and not to change it. The See also precedes the References, Further reading, and External links; the reason for the existing order follows a logical progression from on-wiki to off-wiki information. About the names of the section headings, different academic fields use different terms, and Wikipedia editors do not want to impose the convention preferred by one academic discipline on articles in another discipline.

Establish a house citation style



[
edit

Wikipedia should establish a house citation style applicable to all articles. This would improve consistency between articles and/or make citing sources easier for new users. Past suggestions include an outside style guide/prescribed format (such as or ), a system preferred by the user's school or teacher(s), and/or a unique style that would meet the specific needs of Wikipedia.
Proposal:
MLA
Harvard referencing
If academics can't find a single system suitable for all fields, why would one system work for Wikipedia? An extreme amount of time and effort would be necessary to (1) develop, or even agree on, a comprehensive house style that covers most or all situations, and (2) implement it on all 6,476,067 articles with sources, even with the help of one or more bots. Any benefits of a single encyclopedia-wide house style pale in comparison to the massive scope of such an undertaking.

Add in-article credit for images



[
edit
]

Wikipedia should include bylines or some other sort of in-article credit for images used in articles. It is sometimes also claimed this is required by CC-BY licenses.
Proposal:

Reasons for previous rejection:

These is no need to clutter articles with this information. Credit is already provided for the majority of images by linking them to the file description page, which includes authorship, licensing, and more. (The exceptions to this are CC0 and public domain images used as icons, where the file description page still exists but is sometimes not linked.)
Maintaining these in-article credits would be a significant maintenance burden on our editors, so there should be a similarly significant advantage to doing it. Such advantage has not been evident.
The existing model of attribution has so far proven to be widely successful, despite resistance by a small number of copyright holders to allowing use of their images without in-article credit.
Mistaken credit of images taken from Wikipedia (e.g. crediting them to "Wikipedia" rather than the actual authors) is an issue, but it is not evident that this would be significantly affected by this proposal.
Including in-article credits would increase the incentive for people to "spam" their images into articles in an attempt to use Wikipedia for free advertising.
Prominently crediting some images without crediting all, including the various icons used in maintenance templates, could itself prove problematic by seemingly valuing some people's contributions over others'. The same applies to prominently crediting image contributions without doing so for text contributions.
And, specific to the CC-BY licenses:

While the CC license deed (a lay summary, not legally binding) says attribution is to be provided "in the manner specified by the author or licensor", this does not mean that the author/licensor can require specific fonts, colors, wording, or placement of the credit. Looking at the actual license (the "legal code"), this seems to be referring to the author/licensor's ability to choose the name to be attributed, the title of the work, and the canonical URL for the work. The actual location and formatting of the attribution is merely required to be "reasonable to the medium" and "at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors".
The assertion that linking to a file description page is not "reasonable to the medium" of a hypertext encyclopedia has not received any significant level of support.
Providing in-article credit for some but not all images might possibly fall afoul of the CC-BY license's "at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors" clause. And providing in-article credit for images and not text contributions may have the same problem; the fact that it is (usually) feasible to do this for images and not text does not factor into the CC-BY license's requirement.

Usernames should contain only Latin characters

Proposals have included banning usernames that include symbols, characters, non-English alphabets, and/or any characters that are not easy to type on "standard" computer keyboards.
Proposal:
Unicode
The notion of acceptable characters broadened to accommodate rules. Very few active users choose names that are difficult to type, so the problem is quite small. Being able to type a name is not necessary, as names can be copied or ignored. Furthermore, banning non-Latin usernames would cause difficulty on Wikipedias in languages that do not use the Latin alphabet, as speakers of those languages may not be able to enter Latin characters with their keyboards and would have a difficult time in choosing a username.

Revert warring to keep a warning on a user's talk page is disruptive and constitutes "" newcomers.

Most custom signatures cause little or no trouble. In addition, they are popular throughout Wikipedia, and forcing users to give them up would create more trouble than it would be worth. It is better to deal with unacceptable signatures on a case-by-case basis than to issue a blanket prohibition that would anger many users, with few or no benefits.

People should be allowed to discuss the topic of the article on talk pages, instead of limiting discussion to improvement of the article. Or forums of some sort should be created to allow this, either on Wikipedia or elsewhere and linked from all articles.
Proposal:
This conflicts with our mission at a fundamental level: our purpose is to create an encyclopedia, not to provide a place for people to hold random discussions on various topics. Similarly, we are not here to endorse any particular external sites for such discussion; people interested in finding such places should use a search engine. Additionally, hosting such discussions would require volunteers or staff to monitor and/or moderate these discussions, delete violations, block or ban disruptive users, and so on, which would reduce the time these people (likely Admins) have to spend on activities that do improve the encyclopedia. Occasionally it is claimed that these forums could provide a place for original research to be "peer reviewed"; this would nonetheless conflict with our policy , even if the "peer review" turned out to be much more rigorous than can be reasonably expected.

All authors must be notified of deletion



[
edit
]

The first creator, or everybody who has contributed to an article, must be warned on their talk page of a deletion debate of that article.
Proposal:
Excessive bureaucracy; people are expected to keep pages important to them on their watchlist. The "first creator" is meaningless for many articles, as this person may have long since left or made few contributions; "everybody" can number several hundred people, including those who have made trivial edits to the article and aren't concerned whether or not it's deleted. Regardless, editors are encouraged to notify the original author or the main contributors of an article when their article is nominated for deletion, as it is considered courteous; this is strictly optional. This puts fewer requirements for a deletion proposal than for a , for which all main contributors must be notified.
Reasons for previous rejection:

Deleted pages should be visible



[
edit
]

Make deleted pages visible to everybody (or to all logged-in users), not just administrators.
Proposal:
That defies the main point of deletion (which is to improve Wikipedia quality by getting rid of the worst parts); also, it would increase the workload of the body to ensure that copyright violations and libelous statements are visible to everybody. The proposal to allow access to all deleted content has been explicitly vetoed by the Wikimedia Foundation legal counsel (). If you have a plausible reason for seeing a particular page, then you can request a . Wikipedia is written by its readers.

Wikipedia should automatically delete articles that do not cite at least one source, via speedy or . This may apply to all articles, newly created articles, or certain types of articles (BLPs, for example).
Proposal:
proposed deletion
Such a practice would "" new users and discourage them from becoming members of the community, as even good-faith contributions are immediately deleted or proposed for deletion. Keep in mind that not all users fully understand our policies and guidelines the minute they start editing. When a brand-new article is started without references, the creator, or another user, is often gathering sources to add later. Many users—both new and experienced—create stubs as a starting point, with the intention of developing them into full-fledged, well-sourced articles. Of course you are free to tag such pages, and to help clear the backlog of and articles, and . However, a deletion process for unreferenced BLPs has been approved, see .

Grace period for deletion



[
edit
]

Pages should be immune to deletion for a certain amount of time after their creation and/or XFD/PROD/speedy nomination. This would give editors time to improve the page or convince editors of its subject's importance, and would help make Wikipedia more friendly and inviting for new users. There may be exceptions for copyright violations, attack pages, etc.
Proposal:
PROD and XFD already have "grace periods" built in, so editors should have ample time to find sources or otherwise improve problematic articles, if possible. As for speedy deletion, are carefully written so that articles can be speedily deleted only if no Wikipedia-compliant article is possible at this time or the content is so dangerous to the encyclopedia it must be removed immediately. A mandatory grace period would also be excessively bureaucratic, and would make it more difficult to delete copyright violations and attack pages, even if there are exceptions for such cases. You can already in your userspace in certain limited cases. If you believe a page was deleted mistakenly or out of process, you are free to request a .

Reconfirm administrators



[

Administrators should have their status reconfirmed through RFA or an RFA-like process, either periodically or on demand.
Proposal:

Reasons for previous rejection:

There are 1,053 administrators. Periodically reconfirming them would be an onerous and time-consuming process. For example, with annual reconfirmation, there would be 20+ reviews . Endorsements of uncontroversial admins would consume much of the schedule, while the "wait time" to review admins who controversial could be on the order of months.

Reconfirmation "on demand" has faced objections about potential abuse.

Hierarchical structures



[
edit
]

There should be some kind of "partial admin" that gets certain admin powers, but not all of them, such as only being allowed to block IP users or only being able to delete pages. Or, new admins should undergo a probationary period, which may include limited abilities or desysopping on demand.
Proposal:
The proposal doesn't solve any of the problems.
Reasons for previous rejection:

If we can't trust people to use their tools sensibly, they don't become admins. Period.
A "partial admin" process would at least double the already considerable frictional effort expended at , as users debate who gets full administrator powers versus who gets only partial abilities.
WP:RFA
The Wikimedia Foundation may require an RFA-style process to access some specific permissions anyway, such as viewing deleted revisions. Therefore, it does not make sense to have people go through one RFA to just get a subset of these tools and then later go through a second RFA if they want the full set of admin permissions.
Many common problems require access to multiple tools (e.g., RevDel, blocking, and page protection for BLP vandalism). Having only a small subset also results in non-optimal responses due to the . This means that a protection-only semi-admin, for example, would sometimes deploy page protection when a user block would be far more appropriate, because page protection is the only tool available to them.
Law of the instrument
It would also increase wasteful overhead, because even admins with the "wrong" powers would have to find, explain the situation to, and request help from someone with the correct power, instead of stopping the problem instantly themselves.
It's confusing. People won't know who can deal with a problem, especially inexperienced users.
Several permissions are available to trustworthy non-admins upon request, such as , or . See for a list and the application process.

Prerequisites for adminship



[

To reduce the number of failed RFAs, all candidates should meet certain requirements, such as a minimum edit count, contributions to featured content, or participation in internal Wikipedia processes like .
Proposal:
articles for deletion
While candidates with few edits and/or a lack of contributions often fail per or , there are always exceptions. The encyclopedia should not lose out on a good candidate just because they have not achieved an arbitrary number of edits or does not frequent a particular area of the encyclopedia. Having a set minimum edit count may not lower the number of failed RfAs substantially, because an otherwise poor candidate could edit just for the sake of meeting the requirements. In addition, are not a reliable indicator of an editor's experience or competence. It is better to evaluate candidates on the of their contributions, not the of their edits.

Allow non- to administer their user space, with the tools technically limited to that space only. This has been proposed in a number of different ways, ranging from individual abilities (such as deletion), to full admin abilities.
Proposal:

Lack of need; admin workload is not high enough to justify this.

Allow watchlisting individual sections of a page




[
edit
]

Allow specific sections of pages to be watchlisted, so editors can monitor small portions of large pages, such as , instead of the whole page.
Proposal:
WP:ANI
While many users support the use of such a feature, the technical implementation of this feature is difficult, if not impossible with the current version of MediaWiki. At the moment, watchlisting is done on a page-by-page basis, as each page is assigned a unique ID number in the database. Page sections, being fluid, are assigned numbers on the page they are situated on, but adding or removing sections above it will change the number. The name of the section can also be changed easily and new sections can be created with the same name. This does not apply to pages which are transcluded within other pages, but this setup is not commonly used.

Create shortcut namespace aliases for various namespaces

Along the lines of the existing WP: ? Wikipedia: and WT: ? Wikipedia talk: namespace aliases, create shortcuts such as T: ? Template:, TT: ? Template talk:, U: ? User:, UT: ? User talk:, P: ? Portal:, CAT: ? Category:, and so on.
Proposal:
Adding shortcuts comes with an increase in complexity that the community in general does not feel is justified by the added convenience. Contributing factors include:
Reasons for previous rejection:

Some namespaces, such as User:, Help:, and Talk:, are already so short that further abbreviation is not really necessary.
Some proposed shortcuts, such as TT: ? Template talk:, conflict with existing , , or prefixes, or codes from that may be used for future interlanguage prefixes.
interlanguage

Some proposed shortcuts, such as T: ? Template: and T: ? Talk:, conflict.
Some proposed shortcuts, such as T: ? Template:, conflict with existing articles. While those articles could be moved as was done for articles such as that conflict with existing namespaces or prefixes, one must ask whether the advantages of a shortcut outweigh the disadvantages of present and future conflicts.
Ki:Theory
Few pages in most of these namespaces are linked or navigated to directly (using browser search boxes or direct URL manipulation) often enough that the savings of a few characters for a few users is worth the hassle for the rest of the community. Those few pages that are can be handled with WP-namespace or shortcuts, or shortcuts with the full namespace prefix.

Move the Main Page to another namespace, such as "Wikipedia:" or "Portal:"



[
edit
]

Since the Main Page isn't an article, it should go in another namespace such as "Wikipedia:" or "Portal:" rather than stay in the main namespace.
Proposal
There is little if any reason for such a move and we would still need to keep a cross-namespace redirect at the current title to avoid breaking probably millions of incoming links. The Main Page in its modern form dates to 2002, before the modern namespace system fully crystallized, and was placed by default in the main namespace. It has remained there since largely due to inertia and lack of a solid reason to move it to another namespace. Being , the Main Page doesn't particularly belong in any of the other namespaces either (with the possible exception of Portals).

The copy-and-paste facility in most computer operating systems already allows people to copy links and paste them into a much wider range of websites than any share or like implementation ever could. In addition, there are potential privacy issues with many "like"/"share" implementations. Most network-sites provide that work on every webpage.
