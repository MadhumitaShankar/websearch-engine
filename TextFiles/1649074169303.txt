The result is displayed on the dashboard of the student after 24 hrs. One gets two chances of attempting LPU NEST. The best of the two results will be applicable for a scholarship. One has to register oneself with the university and pay online for taking LPU NEST. The application form will be in a format that can be processed by Optical Mark Reader (OMR). One can get an LPU NEST kit that consists of a University Information Brochure containing details of Infrastructure, Global Character, Placements, Academics, Student Services, Campus life, etc. One can get the test altered and can avail a second chance as well. The best out of the two results will be considered for scholarships. One can go to the admission offices physically and fill the forms manually as well.

No CLAT is not mandatory. Admission for BBA LL.B. Vansthali is based on Merit in the qualifying examination ( I. e 10+2 marks).

Candidates who are appearing in the qualifying examination in March/April, 2022 are also eligible to appear in CLAT 2022 examination. However, they shall be required to produce an evidence of their passing the qualifying examination at the time of admission, failing which they shall lose their right to be considered for admission.
