Scotland is in the grip of a crisis of addiction, homelessness and poverty – a country where the poorest can expect to die around a decade younger than the most affluent. Disclosure goes behind the statistics to meet those living on the edge and battling to get help and support.
In a unique collaboration, BBC Scotland joins with investigative website The Ferret to work with citizen journalists who themselves have experiences with addiction, and asks what can be done to bring people back in from the margins.
