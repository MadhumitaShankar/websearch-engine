The truth about Spy Rock


In the second programme in this 4-part series, Tony Blair's former chief of Staff, Jonathan Powell, reveals why Britain responded the way it did when British diplomats were accused of spying, and using a fake rock to transmit data.
The programme goes on to look at coloured revolutions in Georgia and Ukraine, and Kremlin officials tell how they made sure that Putin wouldn't face a similar revolution at home.
Critics of Putin were intimidated or even murdered and tens of thousands of young Russians were mobilised to fight the threat of democracy, while the spy rock incident became part of the justification for a new law, restircting the activity of NGOs.
