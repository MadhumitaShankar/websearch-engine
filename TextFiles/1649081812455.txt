How do I set the video quality on my connected TV or games console?





Click on in the app
Settings
Then select
Video Quality
Choose either / or (we'll explain Best Quality below)
Best Quality
High Definition
Standard Definition
If you set HD as the default, BBC iPlayer will still play the SD version for programmes that aren’t available in HD.


Why am I seeing a Best Quality option instead of High Definition?

You'll see this if your connected TV device or games console supports HTTP Live Streaming (HLS). This allows you to get the best quality video your internet speed can support. Video playback quality will adapt to the speed of your internet connection.
