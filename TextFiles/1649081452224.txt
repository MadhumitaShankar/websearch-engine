We use your personal information to make the BBC better for you and for everyone. That includes doing things like:

Recommending things we think you’ll enjoy, like TV and radio programmes
Notifying you about things you’ve told us you like, for example a new series of your favourite TV show
Personalising parts of the BBC to your tastes, including emails, radio, news, iPlayer and music
We also use it for business, regulatory and legal purposes, like:

Dealing with any requests you make or content you submit
Getting in touch if we need to tell you about something, like a change to our policies or issues with a service. Or to tell you if your BBC account hasn’t been used in a long time and to ask if you’d still like to use it
Identifying where you are and giving you the right version of the BBC for this area
We share some of your personal information with TV Licensing to check if you are using BBC iPlayer and to keep their database up to date. .
