As far as PSUs are concerned, there is very less scope for civil engineers. The interview calls are solely based on a candidate’s GATE rank. Some PSUs also conduct their separate exams after the interview. They also check for a candidate’s BE aggregate.

Q. What are some journals publishing recent research in civil engineering?
A. Following is the list of few international journals related to civil engineering:

International Journal of Civil Engineering
Journal of Civil Engineering and Architecture-David Publishing Company
Civil Engineering and Architecture
International Journal of Structural and Civil Engineering Research
Page on asce.org

Q. I am a 2nd-year civil engineering student. Where should I go for training? Is it necessary to go for training?
A. The need for training depends on the plans for the kind of profession you want to choose in future. It would be very helpful for a field job. Civil engineering can only be learnt completely on the field by observing how things work. For a career in consultancy and design structures, field training will also be very helpful. You should go for a training.

Q. As a future civil engineer, which foreign language would be beneficial for me?
A. It depends on the nation you'd be going after completing the graduation. The country’s language where you'll be posted help you to do internships and get project works.

Q. What are the top companies to pursue an internship in India?
A. The choice company for internships majorly depends on the sector you want to join after completing your course. Following is the list of some top companies of different sectors related to civil engineering:

Structural Engineering/Geo-technical Engineering:

Indian Railways
Public Works Department
Real Estate Companies

Transportation Engineering:

National Highway Authority of India
Public Works Department
Airport Authority of India

Environmental Engineering:

Public Health Department
Municipal Committee of any city

Building Materials:

H&R Johnson Tiles
Townships/Real Estate Developers

Q. What should I choose after completion of a bachelor’s degree in civil engineering, post-graduation or job?
A. Civil engineering degree holders can go for various advance courses in Drafting and Design, Structural Design and Surveying. They can also go for a job in the sector. Whatever candidates choose the job or higher education depends on their interests. However, job options are better after a postgraduate degree.

Q. What do the civil engineers will do?
A. Civil engineers are into building, supervising, operating, constructing and designing projects in the public and private sector. They also take projects including roads, airports, tunnels, dams, bridges, and systems for water supply and sewage treatment.

Best universities offering Job opportunities in civil engineering after B.Tech in India at Chandigarh University in Punjab is a good choice for a better career. Because we will study geotechnical, structural, environmental, and transportation engineering at Chandigarh University, we will be able to realize our dreams. Chandigarh University offers a comprehensive civil engineering degree that gives students hands-on experience. CU students gain a solid grasp of the topic because of a well-designed curriculum, committed instructors, project work, industry visits, guest lectures, and exposure to various civil engineering software packages. When it comes to placements, there are a lot of MNCs and other firms like Saint Gobain, Everest, V-Construct, and others. I went to Chandigarh University, where a large number of academics were named. I believe CU is one of the more fashionable engineering choices I made.

Due to new infrastructures being introduced in India civil engineering has high demands. For that Chandigarh, the university is best for all things. The placement cell in Chandigarh University is ever since day one of the college. Last year, overall, the placement percentage was 60%. The highest package was 33 LPA, and the average package as of now is 4.5 LPA. The students were offered different kinds of jobs from a software tester to HR. The internships at Chandigarh University don't talk much because the students don't get any support from the placement or training cell. The internships at CU are the student's responsibility.

Civil engineering is growing in India now due to new infrastructures due to which Chandigarh university is providing the best possibilities to r grasp that opportunities such as follows: A batch consists of around 70 students out of which approximately 30 to 40 students got placed. Out of these, about 10 to 15 students got placed in core companies like Tata Advanced Systems which offered the highest salary package of 6 LPA, Capgemini, and Aerospace which offered the salary package of 3.8 LPA, Indigo which offered the salary package of 5 LPA, and Aviotron Automations which offered the salary package of 3.6 LPA. The rest of the students did not get placed or opted for non-core companies. Infrastructure: The infrastructure of the university is amazing, and our engineering block looks modern. For our aerospace department, two floors are allotted with classrooms and labs. There are different types of labs like aerodynamics (wind tunnel and water tunnel) and aircraft structure (wing structure components). Aircraft propulsion lab (which is non-operational, but the JET engine is available) and instrument and system lab (aircraft hangar outside the building with Cessna aircraft) are also available. Our university library has books related to our department, but students should get permission from professors to access most of the reference books. The hostel complex is pretty huge with tuck shops, mess, restaurant, and all things inside it. LAN ports are provided in every hostel room so that students can use the Wi-Fi facility. There are medical dispensary and sports facilities on our university premises.

Civil engineering is not much tough as compared to other engineering branches. But if you did your civil engineering at Chandigarh university you will get many benefits such as follows: The placement percentage is almost 80%, but the package may differ in accordance with the company tier. The average salary package is Rs 25,000-50,000 per month. Even students can sit in placements other than their stream. Infrastructure: The infrastructure is good in this college. Laboratories are good and it also has some expensive machines. Faculty: The experience is good, but when it comes to theory it starts after 1 year. So, students' first year is basic, and they might find it uninteresting. It workshops are good in this college.
