Biotechnology engineering is an undergraduate degree programme in applied sciences that amalgamates the facts from both Biological sciences and technology. This study utilizes the biological processes which include the study of microorganisms or knowledge of antibiotics and further implement them in various industrial purpose.
In simple terms, Biotechnology is a study which involves the use of living organisms. The living organisms are used to make useful chemicals which can be utilized in industries. Biotechnological products are used in areas like agriculture, food sciences and medicine.

Required Skillsets for Biotechnology Engineers



Biotechnology engineers tend to work with a broad range of medical, technical and admin professionals. The key skillsets include:

Tissue culture is one of the most widely used techniques in any biological or biomedical research lab. If you are looking for a placement or job, tissue culture will be a very valuable biotechnology skill to have.
PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) is a technique used to make many copies of a specific DNA region in vitro.
Gel electrophoresis is another widely used technique in molecular biology, biochemistry, genetics and modern biotechnology.
Western blot, also known as protein immunoblot, is a popular molecular biology technique for the detection and analysis of proteins based on their ability to bind to specific antibodies.
ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) is a popular format of “wet-lab” type analytic biochemistry assay that uses a solid-phase enzyme immunoassay (EIA) to detect the presence of a substance, usually an antigen ( peptides, proteins, antibodies and hormones), in a liquid sample or wet sample.
Molecular cloning or simply gene cloning is a molecular biology technique that is used to assemble recombinant DNA molecules and to direct their replication within host organisms.
Flow cytometry is a laser- or impedance-based technique used in cell counting, cell sorting, biomarker detection and protein engineering, by suspending cells in a stream of fluid and passing them through an electronic detection apparatus.
Mass spectrometry (MS) is an analytical technique that ionises chemical species and sorts the ions based on their mass-to-charge ratio.
Confocal microscopy is an optical imaging technique for increasing optical resolution and contrast of a micrograph by means of adding a spatial pin-hole placed at the confocal plane of the lens to eliminate out-of-focus light.
Cell-based assays are extremely useful for studying cellular mechanisms in a biological context.
Apart from the wet lab techniques, data analysis using proper statistical methods and software is very important in biotechnology and medical research.


Eligibility Criteria for Biotechnology Engineering



The minimum eligibility criteria required in order to pursue a BTech programme in Biotechnology states that a candidate should have completed their + 2 education with PCB. While there are engineering institutes that consider Mathematics a compulsory subject in order to offer admissions to candidates, institutes like JNU does not make maths mandatory for seeking admissions into the BTech in Biotechnology programmes. Candidates who have studied Biology in +2 can also apply for admissions.






Course curriculum for Biotechnology Engineering
