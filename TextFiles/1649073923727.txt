There are no. Of difference between twos: Professors in Executive MBA programme serves as facilitators more so then lecturers. They offer guidance and share their perspective and experiences in a dynamic exchange with students. Professors in EMBA programs are typically both industry experts and highly regarded academics. Whereas, in traditional MBA teaching style are generally more lecture-based as professors provide students with the academic fundamentals. MBA Executive programs are generally shorter in duration and class modules are competed at a more intense peace to minimize disruption from work and family for senior executives.

Mentor's guidance will always add up to your knowledge. You can solve your doubt and get a better perspective regarding your confusions. It is always good to have clarity rather than making mistakes. Your mentor knows you better and can guide as per your skill set, strengths and your desired career path. So, you should go to the mentor you connect the best with. Rest will depend upon your preparation and hardwork for the exam.
