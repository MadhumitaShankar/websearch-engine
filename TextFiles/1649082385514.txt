Can I remove audio description?




Sometimes only the audio described or signed versions of a programme are available on BBC iPlayer. The audio description is built into that version and can't be removed.
. The audio described version of a programme is often broadcast a few days after the standard version, so there will be a period where it's the only version available.
If you can't find the original version of the episode, it's because that version of the programme has expired
Can I switch audio description off if the original version is still available?

Yes, if the original version of the episode you want to watch is still available on BBC iPlayer.

Switch over to the non-AD version by selecting on the white bar at the top of the playback screen, or at the bottom of the playback screen.
