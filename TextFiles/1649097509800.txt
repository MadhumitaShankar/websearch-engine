Protected pages may not be edited except to make changes that are uncontroversial or for which there is clear consensus. Editors convinced that the protected version of an article contains policy-violating content, or that protection has rewarded edit warring or disruption by establishing a contentious revision, may identify a stable version the edit war and reversion to that version. Before making such a request, editors should consider how independent editors might view the suggestion and recognize that continuing an edit war is grounds for being blocked.

Administrators who have made substantive content changes to an article are considered and must not use their advanced permissions to further their own positions.

However, brief periods of an appropriate and reasonable protection level are allowed in situations where blatant vandalism or disruption is occurring by multiple users and at a level of frequency that requires its use in order to stop it. The duration of the protection should be set as short as possible, and the protection level should be set to the lowest restriction needed in order to stop the disruption while still allowing productive editors to make changes.

A page and its talk page should not normally be protected at the same time. If a page and its talk page are both protected, the talk page should direct affected editors to to ensure that no editor is entirely prevented from contributing.
Wikipedia:Request for edit
Protection should be used sparingly on the talk pages of blocked users, including IP addresses. Instead the user should be re-blocked with talk page editing disallowed. When required, or when re-blocking without talk page editing allowed is unsuccessful, protection should be implemented for only a brief period not exceeding the duration of the block.

When to apply pending changes protection


Pending changes may be used to protect articles against:

Persistent vandalism
Violations of the policy
biographies of living persons

Copyright violations
Pending changes protection should not be used as a preemptive measure against violations that have not yet occurred. Like semi-protection, PC protection should be used in genuine content disputes, where there is a risk of placing a particular group of editors (unregistered users) at a disadvantage. Pending changes protection should not be used on articles with a very high edit rate, even if they meet the aforementioned criteria. Instead, semi-protection should be considered.
never
In addition, administrators may apply temporary pending changes protection on pages that are subject to significant but temporary vandalism or disruption (for example, due to media attention) when blocking individual users is not a feasible option. As with other forms of protection, the time frame of the protection should be proportional to the problem. Indefinite PC protection should be used only in cases of severe long-term disruption.
Removal of pending changes protection can be requested of any administrator, or at .

User talk pages







Shortcut



WP:UTPROT
User talk pages are rarely protected. However, protection may be applied if there is severe vandalism or abuse. Users whose talk pages are protected may wish to have an unprotected user talk subpage linked conspicuously from their main talk page to allow good-faith comments from users that the protection restricts editing from.
A user's request to have their own talk page protected is not a sufficient rationale by itself to protect the page, although requests may be considered if a reason is provided.

Blocked users


Blocked users' user talk pages should not ordinarily be protected, as this interferes with the user's ability to contest their block through the normal process. It also prevents others from being able to use the talk page to communicate with the blocked editor.
In extreme cases of abuse by the blocked user, such as abuse of the {{}} template, re-blocking the user with talk page access removed should be preferred over applying protection to the page. If the user has been blocked and with the ability to edit their user talk page disabled, they should be informed of this in a block notice, subsequent notice, or message, and it should include information and instructions for appealing their block off-wiki, such as through the or, as a last recourse, .

IP editors and unconfirmed accounts are also unable to create or edit user pages that do not belong to a currently-registered account. This protection is enforced by . Users may opt-out of this protection by placing anywhere on their own user page.

and subpages within their own user space may be protected upon a request from the user, as long as a need exists. Pages within the user space should not be automatically or pre-emptively protected without good reason or cause. Requests for protection specifically at uncommon levels (such as template protection) may be granted if the user has expressed a genuine and realistic need.
User pages

[14]

[15]
When a filter is insufficient to stop user page vandalism, a user may choose to create a ".css" subpage (ex. User:Example/Userpage.css), copy all the contents of their user page onto the subpage, transclude the subpage by putting on their user page, and then ask an administrator to fully protect their user page. Because user space pages that end in ".css", ".js", and ".json" are editable only by the user to which that user space belongs (and interface administrators), this will protect your user page from further vandalism.
{{User:Example/Userpage.css}}

Deceased users

Wikipedia:Deceased Wikipedians/Guidelines
In the event of the confirmed death of a user, the user's user page (but not the user talk page) should be fully protected.

Protection of templates

Wikipedia:High-risk templates
Wikipedia:Template documentation
Highly visible templates – those used on a large number of pages or frequently substituted – are often edit protected based on the degree of visibility, type of use, content, and other considerations.
Protected templates should normally have the {{}} template. It loads the unprotected page, so that non-admins and IP-users can edit the documentation, categories and interwiki links. It also automatically adds {{}} to protected templates, which displays a small padlock in the top right corner and categorizes the template as protected. Only manually add to protected templates that don't use (mostly the flag templates).

pp-template

{{documentation}}
Cascading protection should generally not be applied directly to templates, as it will not protect transclusions inside tags or transclusions that depend on template parameters, but protect the template's . Instead, consider any of the following:
<includeonly>
will
documentation subpage

If the set of subtemplates is static (even if large), protect them using normal protection mechanisms.
If the set of subtemplates is unbounded, use to protect all subtemplates using a particular naming format (as is done for and subtemplates of ).

Sandboxes



See also:
Wikipedia:About the sandbox
Sandboxes should not ordinarily be protected since their purpose is to let new users test and experiment with . Most sandboxes are automatically cleaned every 12 hours, although they are frequently overwritten by other testing users. The is cleaned every hour. Those who use sandboxes for malicious purposes, or to violate policies such as , , or , should instead be warned and/or blocked.

Module:Protection banner
On redirect pages, use the {{}} template, which automatically categorizes by protection level, below the redirect line. A protection template may also be added below the redirect line, but it will serve only to categorize the page, as it will not be visible on the page, and it will have to be manually removed when protection is removed.
