You must score at least 50% in the OEE entrance exam. It may vary if you have done undergraduate from a university other than Pune University. Mostly above 50% in OEE books the seat for admission.

Actually this is specialisation course and generally comes at the time of Masters or Diploma level. You can go for certification along with your graduation you can do Masters post graduation. For graduation it is very difficult to find a course in good college.
