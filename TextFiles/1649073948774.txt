Materials Science (also referred to as materials science and engineering) is an inter-disciplinary subject that involves the study of all materials starting from a glass or a piece of sports equipment to those used in medicine and aerospace. The subject explores the structure and design of any material and how it can be used in the most optimum way.
Apart from this, the field of materials science also focuses on the creation of new materials on the basis of different engineering requirements. The materials created through this field of science are used for a variety of purposes and range from nanotechnology to advanced polymers.
Through their understanding of how materials work, materials scientists or engineers create new materials for new applications and develop existing materials to improve performance. Materials science is a broad field of study and contains plenty of opportunities for students who wish to build their careers in it and its related technologies.

FAQs Regarding Materials Science

What is Materials Science
Materials Science is an interdisciplinary subject that involves Physics and Chemistry of Matter, Engineering applications and industrial manufacturing processes. The subject deals with the interconnection between the structure and properties of a material and its manufacturing process.
The duration of the undergraduate Materials Science course is four years and that of the postgraduate course is two years. The curriculum includes Engineering and Science subjects such as Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, and its sub-topics such as metals, materials, alloys, ceramics, biomaterials, magnetic and optical materials, to name a few.




Materials Science Eligibility Criteria
Materials science can be pursued by candidates at undergraduate, postgraduate and doctorate levels. Given below are the eligibility criteria for all levels of materials science courses:
: Candidates should clear Class 12 in the Science stream with at least 50 per cent to 60 per cent aggregate.
UG Level
: Candidates should clear graduation preferably in materials science with at least 50 per cent to 60 per cent aggregate.
PG Level
: Candidates should clear post-graduation in materials science or a related discipline with at least 60 per cent to 75 per cent marks. Candidates clearing (with minimum 90 to 95 percentile) or and had Mathematics as a mandatory subject in graduation are also eligible to apply.
PhD Level
GATE
CSIR UGC NET
: Materials science eligibility criteria mentioned above might vary depending on the policy of the university in which a candidate is applying for admission.
Note

Materials Science Admission Process
