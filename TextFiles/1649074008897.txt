I highly recommend everyone to take adm in IIT Delhi if he/she cross IIT Delhi cutoff.

Placements:
Around 85-90% student get placed in my branch. Actually those student who sit in placement get placed, rest go for master or higher studies. Average package of this branch is 16 lpa+. Those student having CGPA 8+ are easily getting internship,7 pointer also got internship.

Infrastructure:
