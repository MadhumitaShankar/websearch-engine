Muslims Ali and Claire are expecting their first child. They are nervous about becoming parents, but just days after the birth, Ali’s parents, sister and sister-in-law descend on them to practise their version of the Muslim tradition of 40 days. Relatives and loved ones help the new parents, and especially the new mum, with the transition to parenthood by looking after them so they can be free to care for the baby. For Claire this practice is going to be especially valuable as she lost her own mother when she was a teenager and doesn’t have any maternal help from her side of the family.
