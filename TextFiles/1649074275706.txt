MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS

MICROSOFT EDGE




After installation, these terms are also viewable in Microsoft Edge at edge://terms.

These license terms are an agreement between you and Microsoft Corporation (or one of its affiliates). They apply to this software published by Microsoft and any software updates (“Software”) (except to the extent such Software or updates are accompanied by new or
additional terms, in which case those different terms apply prospectively and do not alter your or Microsoft’s rights relating to pre-updated Software
). IF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE RIGHTS BELOW.
BY DOWNLOADING OR USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THEM, YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO AND MUST NOT DOWNLOAD OR USE THE SOFTWARE.


1.

MICROSOFT EDGE FOR WINDOWS DEVICES


1.1.

Windows License Terms
. Your installation and use of the Software on any Windows platform shall be governed by the license terms for your Microsoft Windows Operating System software (“Windows License Terms”) on which you are using the Software, and those terms are incorporated by reference. If the Software is downloaded from Microsoft and labeled preview, insider, beta or pre-release, or is otherwise indicated as not being a final retail version of the Software, the applicable terms in Section 1.2 also apply to your use of the Software. Section 1.3 applies to your use of other services that may be made available for use through your use of the Software.


1.1.1.

Updates
. Notwithstanding above Section 1.1 as applied to Windows 7, 8, and 8.1, the terms of the applicable Windows License Terms, or any Windows update settings you have configured, the Software periodically checks for updates, and downloads and installs them for you. You may obtain updates only from Microsoft or authorized sources, and Microsoft may need to update your system to provide you with those updates. By accepting this agreement, you agree to receive these types of automatic updates without any additional notice.


1.2.

Previews
. Microsoft may make preview, insider, beta or other pre-release versions of the Software (“Previews”) available to you. You may use Previews only up to the Software’s expiration date (if any) and so long as you comply with the applicable Windows License Terms. Previews are experimental, which means that Previews may not operate correctly and may be substantially different from the commercially released version. In some instances, Previews may even inadvertently damage your device rendering it inoperable or cause occasional crashes, data loss or apps to stop working or be deleted. To recover, you may have to reinstall your apps, the operating system or re-flash your device. In some instances, you may not be able to go back to your prior version of the Software. Because Previews may contain more errors or inaccuracies, you should back-up your device before installing any Previews. We recommend installing Previews on non-production devices that are not business critical because you are more likely to experience crashes, setting and policy changes, loss of data or apps, feature and functionality changes, cause other apps to stop working, be updated, or removed from your device automatically without notice and other potential issues. We highly recommend that you do not install the Previews on any systems you don’t directly control or that you share with others. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this agreement, Previews are nontransferable and provided “AS IS.” By installing Previews on your device, you may void or impact your device warranty and may not be entitled to support from the manufacturer of your device or network operator, if applicable. Microsoft may not provide support services for Previews. If you provide Microsoft comments, suggestions or other feedback about the Preview (“Submission”), you grant Microsoft and its partners rights to use the Submission in any way and for any purpose. You will not give a Submission that is subject to a license that requires Microsoft to license its Software or documentation to third parties because Microsoft includes your Submission in them. These rights survive this agreement. Microsoft may change or discontinue the Previews, or terminate your access to the Previews, at any time without notice and for any reason whatsoever. You may stop using the Previews at any time by un-installing and deleting all copies of any Previews.


1.2.1.

Data Collection for Previews
. Previews may not have included, reduced, or different security, privacy, accessibility, availability and relatability standards relative to commercially provided services and software. For Previews covered under Section 1.2, privacy and feature settings may not work as intended, and the Previews may not work with other Windows privacy settings, including the diagnostic data settings for Windows 10 / Windows 11. Data collected from your use of the Previews, including diagnostic, technical, error reports, crash dumps and other related data from your devices running Previews may be used, stored, processed and analyzed to keep Windows and the Previews up to date, secure, and operating properly. It also helps us improve Microsoft products and services and may be used for any other purpose described in the Microsoft Privacy Statement. If you disable data collection through controls available in the Previews, we may continue to collect diagnostic information about the download, the installation and removal of the Previews and “basic” data as described in the Windows Diagnostics section of the Microsoft Privacy Statement. The ( ), and this paragraph, applies to Previews under Section 1.2.
Microsoft Privacy Statement

https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839
.

1.3.

Other Services
The Software may include features that provide an access point to, or rely on, other services, websites, links, content, material, integrations or applications, including as provided by independent third parties (“Other Services”). Your use of Other Services or of Software features that rely on Other Services may be governed by separate terms and subject to separate privacy policies. You can view these separate terms and policies through the Other Services’ websites or settings, as applicable. The Other Services may not be available in all regions. You may not use tokens the Software uses to call into a Microsoft Azure service separate from the Software.
