If you are inquiring about placements in engineering, then LPU provides ample opportunities to each and every eligible students to secure good placement. The university has been ranked high by outer agencies also with regard to placements of our students. But as far as mechatronic engineering is concerned, the batch started last year only, so the placement record is under construction for this stream. But LPU assures the placement of all its deserving candidates and would strive high when time would come for the placements of its mechatronic engineering students.
