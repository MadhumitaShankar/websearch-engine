Hello Ayesha Asadnov, it's very nice to hear from you that you are interested in doing studies in Texas. I would strongly recommend that you must approach an agency that is dealing with sending students to US. This is so as admissions there are NIT based on only academic performance but on many more things. These agencies will guide you correctly. Best wishes to you.
