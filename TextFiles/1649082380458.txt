What devices support accessibility features?




We’re committed to making our broadcast and online services as accessible as possible. However, the availability of subtitles and audio described programmes varies between the different versions of BBC iPlayer due to technical limitations.
Subtitles

Subtitles are available for on-demand programmes and downloads (where available) on:

BBC iPlayer app on mobiles and tablets
BBC iPlayer app on most connected TV devices
BBC iPlayer app on games consoles
BBC iPlayer website on computers and laptops
BBC iPlayer website on mobiles and tablets
BT Vision
Chromecast (black & white subtitles only)
Freesat G2
Sky On Demand (programmes broadcast since 26 October 2020)
Sky Q (via the BBC iPlayer app)
Virgin Media TiVo
YouView
We’re working on making subtitles available on Apple TV (4th Generation).
Subtitles on live TV channels

Subtitles are available on our live TV channel streams on the BBC iPlayer website and on our TV app.* This is a trial which is available on all channels apart from BBC Parliament, BBC Alba and S4C. We hope to roll out this functionality to the BBC iPlayer mobile/tablet app in the future.
*Whilst we try to make subtitles available on as many browsers and operating systems as possible, there are times when this isn't possible, particularly on older devices.
