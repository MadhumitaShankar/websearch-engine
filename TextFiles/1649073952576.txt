Did you qualify for your 12th from Pcm? If yes then you can try by giving GATE and CUSAT entrance exams to getting admission in PG courses in power engineering. But if you have no knowledge regarding Maths and Physics or any interest in it I don't think you should divert your mind to another subject. And this competitive exam you can give after getting 50% marks just in your Maths and English respectively. Most probably you are ineligible for power engineering but still if you want then try.
