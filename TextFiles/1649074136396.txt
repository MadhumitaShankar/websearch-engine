Those interested in both professions should try for NDA first, but prepare themselves more for IIT, because if you can crack JEE exams, then you can surely crack the written exam of NDA. As for the SSB part, like they say either you have it, or you don't.

The University also provides the option of credit transfer and international exposure to their students. If I talk about the placements, the placement preparation is started from the very first year. Students are being given placement-oriented classes and even company-specific input also. Thousands of LPU students have got placed in top MNCs and are working all over the Globe. The highest Package Availed by Engineering (CSE) Student, Ms Tanya Arora is 42 LPA for batch 2020 by Microsoft. Students are placed in WorkIndia at 35 LPA; CLOUDERA at 31 LPA; AMAZON at a package of 30 LPA. An average package ranges from 5-10 LPA. Every year visiting companies escalate in number and till date University has recorded the highest placements in North India. The last is about extra-curricular activities. There is a separate division known as the Division of Student Welfare where there are various clubs that a student can join. Hope this helps! Thanks.

Dear Aspirant, Do not worry if you have dropped a year for the NDA preparation. You can take admission to the B.Tech (CSE) programme if you fulfill the eligibility criteria for the same. Many good institutes offer B.Tech (CSE) and every institute has its eligibility criteria. Being an alumnus of LPU I would share the eligibility criteria for B.Tech (CSE). To get admission you should have a minimum of 60% marks in the 12th class with mandatory subjects English Math, and Physics. Moreover, you need to qualify for the LPU NEST exam conducted by LPU. If you have not studied English as a subject, then you must have to provide proof of medium of instruction in English from your school or college. Also, you have to justify your gap of one year and it is not a big deal. I would like to tell you that the maximum package availed by the student for CSE is Rs. 42 LPA. CSE students get many specializations while studying CSE to enhance their knowledge according to their interests such as Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Cloud Computing, Cyber Security, Data Science, etc. I hope this helps. Good Luck!

Hello! Leela Varma, NDA is not an engineering college. It's training establishment for students who want to join armed forces. UPSC conducts an entrance exam twice in a year for this purpose. Ok? Best wishes to you.
