Display access keys


By modifying , access key shortcuts can be displayed before internal links on any Wikipedia page.

CSS with shortcuts shown on hover

Play the video to see how this CSS snippet works. The skin used here is Vector, but this will work for any skin.

CSS with shortcuts shown always





Adding this code displays the access keys on every Wikipedia page, as shown in this picture.

CSS with shortcuts shown always with a box





This is identical to the above code except the access keys are displayed with boxes around them.





a

This will not work in versions lower than 8.0, since those browsers do not support the CSS selector used in these examples.
Internet Explorer

This also will not display the accesskeys provided by the VisualEditor (or the ), such as '' to publish the page, as those accesskeys are implemented differently.

Keyboard shortcuts, in the way they are implemented on Wikipedia, are useful for some users with disabilities and do not require JavaScript to work. At the same time, they are bothersome for some screen reader users because it interferes with the shortcuts of their screen reader. The best solution would be to have customizable keyboard shortcuts.
The accessibility of keyboard shortcuts (access keys) is a complicated matter. This feature, in its current implementation, was temporarily abandoned in 2.0, notably because it conflicts with the shortcuts of assistive technologies. Usage of access keys is currently discouraged in the online contents and applications.
