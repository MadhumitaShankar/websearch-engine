The Korean TV family epic is 'unsurpassed among recent series', writes Caryn James.


T


The family epic is a shop-worn genre, but the creators of Pachinko reinvent it in their dazzling, heartfelt series about four generations of a Korean family that moves to Japan. The story starts in a poor fishing village in 1915, when Korea was under Japanese occupation, and goes through to the polished world of high finance in Tokyo and New York in 1989. But that saga is delivered with such artistry and imagination – including the passionate yet restrained emotions of the actors, the elegance of the time-shifting narrative and the show's astonishing visual beauty – that Pachinko is unsurpassed among recent series.

Why we got the Vikings wrong
Based on Min Jin Lee's bestselling 2017 novel, the story centres on Sunja, played as a girl by Yu-na Jeon, in a delightful performance. For much of the story, Min-ha Kim plays her as a young woman who moves to Japan with her husband, a Korean minister. But the true heart of the series is Yuh-jung Youn, who won last year's best supporting actress Oscar as the blunt but warm grandmother in . She plays the older Sunja, who lives in Osaka with her son, Mozasu (Soji Arai), the owner of pachinko gaming parlours (arcades popular in Japan where people play a game resembling pinball). All three actresses mesh perfectly, depicting a life that includes a misbegotten romance in Korea, and years of hard work in Japan selling kimchi from a street cart to support her family. The oldest Sunja's calm but expressive face contains them all. Wise, observant, deeply feeling and still troubled, she carries the weight of her personal past and of history.
Minari
While Sunja's trajectory is essentially the same as in the novel, the show's creator, Soo Hugh (The Terror), and its directors, Kogonada and Justin Chon, have radically transformed the book. The novel's straightforward chronology owes a debt to 19th-Century narratives. But the series opens with Sunja's pregnant mother asking for a curse to be lifted so she will not miscarry her child, then immediately leaps ahead to New York in 1989, where Sunja's grandson, Solomon (Jin Ha) is on the rise at an investment banking firm. From there the series keeps moving back and forth, picking up the forward movement of each timeline. This is not complication for complication's sake, but a brilliant stroke. Many episodes from the past flow gracefully from the older Sunja as if they are her flashbacks, adding a poignant layer of memory that enhances the show's emotional power, and gives the screen Pachinko a sharper, 21st-Century feel.
In the 1989 timeline, Mozasu has made money with his pachinko parlours. But his profession is considered disreputable in polite society, adding a thread to the themes of class and discrimination that run through the decades. In Sunja's youth, Japanese police beat and threaten innocent Koreans in their own country. Mozasu, although born in Japan, is still considered an outsider there. The mix of languages the characters speak – Korean and Japanese with English in the brief New York scenes – call attention to the divide, with subtitles for different languages in different colours.

The entire cast is stunning and natural. Lee Min-ho, a major star in South Korea, is the charismatic Hansu, a Korean who works for a Japanese company and returns home as a broker at the fish market near Sunya's village. Dashing in a white suit and fedora, he is drawn to the modest, trusting, teenaged Sunja, who is dazzled by him despite rumours of his ties to organised crime. His life and hers intersect through the years.
Jin Ha, a US actor (Devs and Love Life), brings complicated layers to Solomon, who goes to Tokyo to try to convince an old Korean woman there to sell her house to make way for his company's building project. His character is greatly enhanced and at times altered from the novel's, which allows the screen version to foreground the family's generational differences and give Solomon more difficult ethical choices. A scene in which he brings his grandmother, Sunja, to visit the older Korean woman is among the most affecting.
Kogonada and Chon (Blue Bayou) direct four episodes each. Throughout, the cameras capture vistas that create an epic feel, looking out across the vast, glittering sea separating Korea and Japan, or down on to Tokyo high rises. Those views move in and out easily, leading to closeups that bring us intimately into the characters' lives. Pachinko is the latest in Kogonada's string of jaw-droppingly good works, including the films Columbus (2017) and the current After Yang, each made with intelligence and amazing visual style.
Among the many smart choices in Pachinko, one of the best is its buoyant, joyful opening credit sequence. Each of the major actors dances down the aisle of the pachinko parlour to the bouncy 1967 song Let's Live for Today. They are in costume but not in character as Hansu/Lee swirls around and holds little Sunja/Yu-na in his arms, Solomon/Ha tosses his suit jacket in the air, and a smiling Mozasu/Soji raises his arms in disco moves. Seeing the actors highlights the fictional quality of the story, but the sheer happiness of the endlessly rewatchable scene signals the resilience of the family they play.
In the first episode, when Sunja is very young, her father tells her of the promise he made when she was just a week old, that "I would do anything to keep the ugliness of the world from touching you". Pachinko captures both the ugliness of a world bound to hurt her, and the profound beauty of her father's love, that endures through the generations and outweighs everything else.
