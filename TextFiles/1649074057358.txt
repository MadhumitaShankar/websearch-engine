LPU NEST is one such initiative to boost the students. It is a test for eligibility/ scholarship which is conducted by LPU.

LPU is a university which offers 200+ programmes where in there are some courses which require the LPU NEST as a necessary measure for the eligibility of the course, for example B.Tech, M.Sc.
