I’m having problems with my password
Page updated: 19 May 2021



Remember, your password needs to include:

Eight or more characters
At least one letter
At least one number or symbol
Be sure to remember your new password for next time, but don't write it down anywhere in case someone finds it.

Can’t remember your password?
You’ll need to reset it. Here's how to do that:

Go to the page.
I’ve forgotten my password
When requested, enter the email you used to register with the BBC. (If you registered with a fake email, you won’t be able to change your password, so you’ll need to register for a new account.)
We’ll then send you an email with a link to reset your password.
When you receive that email, click the link and you’ll be taken to a page where you can create a new password.
Be sure to remember your new password for next time, but don't write it down anywhere in case someone finds it.

Can’t find the email?
Check your junk or spam folder. It might have been put in there by an overzealous spam filter.

Still can’t find it?
Follow the steps above again to get a new email.

Under 13?
Sorry, but you can’t reset your password if you’ve forgotten it. Instead you’ll need to .
register for a new BBC account
Be sure to remember your password this time, but don't write it down anywhere in case someone finds it.
