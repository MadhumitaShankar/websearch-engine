Onkar visits one of the first ever tandoori restaurants in Wales. The Akash opened up in the 1960s, a time when spice, heat and exotic recipes had never been tasted in Wales, and going out for a meal was something you only did if you had cash to splash. Indian restaurants opened up the dining out experience to the working classes and transformed taste buds in the process.
The Akash is still run by the same Bangladeshi family today, and Onkar meets sisters Dee and Najema, who run the restaurant. As Onkar tucks into a curry that has been on the menu since day one, the sisters reveal the hurdles their father overcame to win over the locals and build up the business. They recall the racism that came with late-night opening and how that impacted their lives growing up but, on a more positive note, how locals became like family with new generations still coming through the doors.
In nearby Pontyclun, Onkar follows his nose to a food factory producing gourmet Indian snacks that fuse the very best of Welsh and Indian flavours. At Samosaco, Onkar finds out how the Sandhu family built up a business that started from a stall at a car boot sale into one of the leading suppliers in the country. He samples the leek and potato samosa and a scotch egg bhaji, and finds out why Wales has made the Sandhus' business such a success.
Hand in hand with good food goes good music. Onkar hits the decks with top bhangra DJ Raj Singh, whose grandfather brought bhangra to these shores. As he has a crash course on the dhol – the bhangra drum – Onkar finds out how this style of music has gone mainstream. During the pandemic, Raj entertained the locals with his bhangra beats and has been immortalised in paint by a local graffiti artist.
Finally, Onkar gets physical as he explores the impact of immigration on Welsh sport. He heads to Swansea to meet a rising star in powerlifting – 20-year-old Muslim Tahira Ali. She puts Onkar through his paces in the gym as he finds out how living in Wales has given Tahira the confidence and support to make it to the top.
