The help resource system of Wikipedia consists of a wide variety of , written to differing levels of technical expertise and in widely varying styles. This variety however has its flaws: it is easy to navigate to a page that regurgitates the same information, contains concepts that have not already been covered, is overly complicated for one's needs, or pages with a listing of links to other pages with listings of links. Information is also spread over a variety of namespace prefixes. The (prefix ): contains many types of pages connected with the Wikipedia project itself: basic information (e.g., ), policies (e.g., ), guidelines (e.g., ), essays (e.g., ), how-to pages (e.g., ). The (prefix ): contains pages which provide help in using Wikipedia and its software, both for users of the encyclopedia and for editors (e.g., ). However the also contains many help style pages that in some cases contain repeated information or more detailed information. For example, and are help pages located in different prefixes covering some of the same information presented in differing levels of technical expertise. There are also pages that have completely different styles of presenting the same information (e.g., and ). For this reason and are often set up between these two namespaces. Aside from the static pages there are a multitude of interactive assistances pages see, for a listing of those.
