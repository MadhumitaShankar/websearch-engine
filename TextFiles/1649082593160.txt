The Muslim tradition that makes sure mother and baby are looked after


Relatives and loved ones help the new parents, and especially the new mum, with the transition to parenthood by looking after them for forty days so they can be free to care for the baby.
For Claire this practice is going to be especially valuable as she lost her own mother when she was a teenager and doesn’t have any maternal help from her side of the family.


Release date:
