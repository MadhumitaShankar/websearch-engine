The BBC privacy promise
Page updated: 3 December 2018



The BBC is a public service. Everything we do has to benefit you, our audience.
We can give you more of what you love when we understand you better. To do that, we ask you to sign in to some of our products and services. We also use your data to benefit you in two ways:

1. A more personal BBC for you
It helps us make the BBC more personal for you. It means we can:

Recommend things we think you’ll like
Show you content that’s relevant to where you live
Make sure you can use things that are appropriate for your age.

2. A better BBC for everyone
As a public service, we need to make something for everyone. As more of our content gets consumed online, it helps to understand who's consuming it so that we can:

Check we really are making something for everyone.
Learn more about what you love so that we can make better stuff in the future.
That's why we ask you to sign in and provide a bit of information.
But throughout all of this, we're committed to make sure your personal, private data stays safe and secure.
