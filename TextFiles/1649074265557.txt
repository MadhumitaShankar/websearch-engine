Violent threats policy











Overview


March 2019

You may not threaten violence against an individual or a group of people. We also prohibit the glorification of violence.
Healthy conversation is only possible when people feel safe from abuse and don’t resort to using violent language. For this reason, we have a policy against threatening violence on Twitter. We define violent threats as statements of an intent to kill or inflict serious physical harm on a specific person or group of people.



What is in violation of this policy?

Under this policy, you can’t state an intention to inflict violence on a specific person or group of people. We define intent to include statements like “I will”, “I’m going to”, or “I plan to”, as well as conditional statements like “If you do X, I will”. Violations of this policy include, but are not limited to:

threatening to kill someone;
threatening to sexually assault someone;
threatening to seriously hurt someone and/or commit a other violent act that could lead to someone’s death or serious physical injury; and
asking for or offering a financial reward in exchange for inflicting violence on a specific person or group of people.


What is not a violation of this policy?

We recognize that some people use violent language as part of hyperbolic speech or between friends, so we also allow some forms of violent speech where it’s clear that there is no abusive or violent intent, e.g., “I’ll kill you for sending me that plot spoiler!”.
This policy is enforced in tandem with our policies on and . Statements that express a wish or hope that someone experiences physical harm, making vague or indirect threats, or threatening actions that are unlikely to cause serious or lasting injury are not actionable under this policy, but may be reviewed and actioned under those policies. we also have a policy against .
