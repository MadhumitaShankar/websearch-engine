Yes, you are eligible for applying in this college, although due to less percentage in graduation it will be a tough competition for you . But, you can back it with good presentation in GD-PI. All the best.

Yes, you are eligible for applying but as you have low percent so you have low chances of getting admission here. Good luck!
