Review of BITS Pilani - Birla Institute of Technology and Science.

Infrastructure:
The Meera Bhawan girls' hostel is an average hostel, not very great in terms of infrastructure. However, the mess food is really good in quality. The HSS department is very well maintained at NAB, which is the newly constructed and well-equipped ...

For ME, the placement scenario can be improved. On-campus placements are less than expected, but our seniors got placed in good companies. A majority of the students also opt for research-based studies, later on, and faculty members are also more focused on research progress, which is good if you plan to pursue a PhD later on. You can also put a practice school according to your choice in the final semester, and you can also invite new companies with your own effort.

It is probably one of the best colleges in India. There are a lot of opportunities available here.

Placements:
Placements in our college are decent. Placements are good for the students of all the circuit branches. The average salary package offered was 14 LPA, and they try to provide placement opportunities for the students of the core branches like mechanical and chemical etc. The average salary package offered is 7 LPA. However, the placement unit does very well at times and brings a lot of companies. Our college offers paid internships. PS II available here is very good, and it offers PPOs.

Infrastructure:
The campus is old but beautiful. The climate conditions are extreme in both the summer and winter seasons. There is no temperature modulation system available in older buildings, and so this makes it tough for students at times. However, new buildings and hostels have AC ducts. Old hostels are equipped only with fans. The campus is getting renovated, and they are renovating every building one after the other. The campus is huge, so we use cycles to commute on the campus.
