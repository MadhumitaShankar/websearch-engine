A is a interested in collaborating on a specific topic within Wikipedia. A WikiProject is a group of people, not a set of pages, a subject area, a list of tasks, or a category. The pages of a WikiProject serve as a central place for coordination, discussion, and organization of the group's activities related to the specific topic. WikiProject pages may be used to develop criteria, maintain various collaborative processes, keep track of work that needs to be done, and act as a forum where relevant issues may be discussed.

user group
Much of the work that participants do to sustain a successful WikiProject (quality assessment, peer review, coordination of volunteer editors, et al.) can be tedious, unrewarding, and unappreciated. To be effective, a WikiProject must foster an among its participants. When group cohesion is maintained—where, in other words, project participants are willing to share in the less exciting work—a WikiProject can muster the energy and direction to produce excellent articles systematically rather than incidentally.
A WikiProject is fundamentally a construct: its success depends on its ability to function as a cohesive group of editors working towards a common goal.

Creating a WikiProject


WikiProjects exist in the and can technically be started by any . However, to avoid the proliferation of unused and underutilized WikiProjects, it is recommended that those interested in starting a WikiProject read the guidance below and propose their project at the .

Before you begin


Interested in starting a WikiProject? First, check to see if the project (or related projects) already exists. You can browse existing projects at the and the as well as the maintained by . Additionally, you can use the searchbox below to text search for existing pages in the project space:
manual directory
automatically curated directory
WikiProject list
Bamyers99






If your project doesn't already exist, it's time to look for editors with similar interests. You find people who want to work together on the project with you. The first stop should be to look for projects with similar interests (if any exist). Use the directories above or check the talk pages of related articles for projects with interests that overlap with yours. Post at the talk pages for those similar projects asking if editors are interested in your starting a project focused on your topic. If you can't find other editors with similar interests, consider participating in a current project instead. Single-editor projects tend to have short lives.
This is the most important step.
must
If your project idea fits within another existing project (e.g. you want to start when already exists), and you're concerned coordination on this topic would either overwhelm the existing project's talk page, or be overwhelmed by it, consider organizing as a under that existing project instead. This would drastically reduce the amount of setup and maintenance required to keep the project pages functioning.

task force
If you're having trouble finding interested editors, consider that the scope of your proposed project may be too narrow. Wikipedia is a huge place with many draws on editors' attention; finding several long-term editors with a sustained interest in one topic may not be easy. Projects with overly narrow scopes tend to become inactive due to lack of editors, not enough associated encyclopedia pages for sustained effort, or competing with a broader-scoped more popular project that draws the time of interested editors. Broadening the proposed scope may help to bring in more pages and editors; although a scope too broad may fail to interest editors who wish to collaborate on only a subset of your topic.

Proposing a project


If the project doesn't yet exist, but you've found interested editors, it's time to propose your project idea! Go to the page and search that page and its to see if your project idea has been proposed before (if it has, be prepared to justify why you feel this time the project will succeed). Follow the instructions on that page to . You'll need to list the pages and that are key to your proposed group, as well as current WikiProjects that relate to those pages. Then interested users will sign-up to support the project (feel free to advertise this at related projects or pages. is not a concern here; however, filling the support roles with new accounts is unlikely to lead to a sustainable project). While there are no hard rules for what constitutes "sufficient" support, projects that are likely to succeed tend to start with at least 6 to 12 active Wikipedians. Once that threshold is reached, the proposal can be considered successful and the project created (see below). If there is insufficient support to start the project after a few months, the proposal will generally be for future reference.

Create the WikiProject


Creating a WikiProject is technically as easy as starting a page titled . However, various tools have been developed to help WikiProjects keep track of pages of interest and to facilitate collaboration on improving the encyclopedia coverage of a topic area. Getting a new project set up utilizing these tools is a slightly complicated process; detailed instructions can be found at . Additionally, you may ask at where interested experienced editors may be willing to help.

Task force


Based on discussion at a WikiProject proposal or at a given WikiProject, you may instead wish to start a under an existing WikiProject. A task force is a group of editors interested in a smaller part of a WikiProject's scope (e.g. is under the ). Creating a task force gives those editors space to collaborate on the part of the WikiProject scope they are interested in, without drowning out broader discussion on the WikiProject's talk page. Additionally, task forces tend to have reduced administrative overhead, as they can use the tools and templates already developed for the parent WikiProject.

General principles



Tagging pages with WikiProject banners


Many WikiProjects use to mark certain pages as within the scope of the WikiProject. This helps the WikiProjects to organize their progress improving pages within the project's scope. Additionally, talk page banners may point interested editors towards relevant WikiProjects where they might become involved, or just ask a question about an article. Consequently, pages should only be marked with WikiProject banners for projects that intend to support the tagged pages. Pages of broad interest may fall within the scopes of several projects, and may therefore have several project banners on their talk page (these banners are often collapsed to be less visible with ). In general, one should not attempt to police which projects are sufficiently relevant to place their banners on a given talk page. Conversely, projects that place their banners on a talk page have no special over that page, and the of project participants can be overruled by a broader consensus at a more visible forum.

WP:PROJGUIDE#OWN
Many editors place banners on behalf of WikiProjects in which they are not participants. This practice is normally welcomed by WikiProjects as it brings to their attention new and interesting articles. Be judicious in making such placements by carefully reviewing the scope of the project. Information about the project's scope is often available on the WikiProject's main page, and sometimes also on documentation associated with the template. All editors should avoid tagging an article with a disruptive number of WikiProject banners. If an article is only tangentially related to the scope of a WikiProject, then please do not place that project's banner on the article. For example, washing for babies reduces transmission of some diseases, but the banners for , , and/or do not need to be added to . If you are uncertain that the placement will be welcomed, leave a note on the project's talk page instead of placing the banner yourself. Note that for projects involved in the assessment program (which is most of them), every banner placed is a demand for an assessment according to the project's guidelines. It is more friendly to omit outside WikiProjects that you think will rate the article as low importance relative to their specific field.

If you place a banner for a WikiProject in which you do not participate, and one of its regular participants removes it, do not re-add the banner without discussion. A WikiProject's participants define the scope of their project (the articles that they to track and support), which includes defining an article as being outside the scope of the project. Similarly, if a WikiProject says that an article is within their scope, do not to remove the banner.

Wikipedia:Policy writing is hard
Many large WikiProjects collect advice about how to apply Wikipedia's to their specific subject area. This advice, sometimes in a separate , sometimes in a section of the WikiProject's main page, is often excellent, and may helpfully consolidate and explain the specific details of many site-wide policies and guidelines, the application of which to a particular context might otherwise cause confusion among editors. A separate-page example is . A page-section example is .

Editors who are working on such an advice page or section are encouraged to carefully study the main policies, guidelines, and relevant well-accepted general Wikipedia essays. The good advice pages with the site-wide pages, and avoid unnecessary duplication of material from them.
do not conflict
WikiProject advice can best help editors by providing: subject-specific considerations in applying site-wide standards; links to subject-specific templates; a list of information that editors should consider including in a given type of article; relevant examples; and clear explanations (e.g., reasons why editors recommend "this" instead of "that"). Well-written WikiProject advice material also takes into account the fact that most articles are within the scope of multiple WikiProjects, and seeks to avoid conflicting advice, which can lead to unproductive "territorial" disputes between projects, and between projects and editors with WikiProject-unrelated editing concerns.
However, in a few cases, projects have wrongly used these pages as a means of asserting within their scope, such as insisting that all articles that interest the project must contain or must not contain , or that a specific type of article can't be linked in , and that other editors of the article get no say in this because of a "consensus" within the project.

However, after being adopted by the community, they are no longer WikiProject advice pages and have the same status as any other guideline. When this happens, the WikiProject's participants cede any notion of control over the page, and everyone in the community participates equally in further development of the guidelines. Such pages move out from under their original "Wikipedia:WikiProject /" path.

Identifying


Many WikiProjects fall inactive after some time. While inactive projects do no harm to the encyclopedia, it may be beneficial to tag them as inactive, in order to divert interested editors to more active projects on similar topics. Projects are generally considered inactive if the talk page has received nothing other than routine/automated announcements or unanswered queries for a year or more. To verify that a project is inactive, post on its talk page asking if anyone minds marking it as such. If there are no objections, you can add to the template at the top of the WikiProject page. This will add the project to and display a message at the top of the page notifying editors of the project's status.

WikiProject status
Category:Inactive WikiProjects
Alternatively, a project that has gone inactive because it has served its stated purpose, had an unrealistic scope, or is otherwise unlikely to be ever revived can be marked as "defunct" per the instructions at . This will generate a more discouraging message, suggesting interested editors look for related projects. Sometimes small, inactive projects are simply into larger, more active projects. This could be a good option if you wish for links to the smaller project to now point to the larger project. If there's still an active community at the smaller project, it could instead be merged as a task force of a larger project. Guidance on that can be found . If an inactive project never seems to have grown beyond its founding, you may consider moving it to the founder's or nominating it for at . In general, medium or larger projects are marked as defunct rather than deleted to preserve the project's history. For more, see .

Use automation (see ) to ensure most if not all appropriate pages are tagged with the project banner, thus promoting the project to those who may be interested. (Don't go overboard with this... in general, don't tag a page not within the project's main category unless you could justify making it the project's Collaboration of the Month.)

Renaming a WikiProject


Renaming a WikiProject is not as simple as moving the WikiProject page itself. The steps involved would generally include:

Rename the relevant categories pages (also may require admin or page mover assistance).
Ensure assessment data has been moved by querying for the new WikiProject at . It may take a while for the data to be updated. If done correctly, no pages should be returned under the old name.
Special:PageAssessments
If the WikiProject uses any of the tools referenced above, you may need to update the WikiProject listings used by those tools to ensure the tools will still work with the new WikiProject name.
