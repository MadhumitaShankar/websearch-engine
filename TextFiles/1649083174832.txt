With summer making way for autumn, the farmers of Eryri begin to reap the fruits of their labour as they send their livestock to market and prepare for the winter months. On the slopes of Cadair Idris, husband and wife team Ken and Lisa Markham are rounding up their ram lambs. A local livestock buyer is coming to select the cream of the Markham’s crop. The money made from selling these lambs will be the first major income raised from the farm for months. Near Bala, Geraint Davies is sorting his lambs ready to be sent to the abattoir. His biggest lambs will end up on supermarket shelves across the UK, but some of his lighter lambs will exported to mainland Europe, a market that could be at risk post-Brexit. Not all the animals sold from the farms will end up on people’s plates, in Llanuwchllyn Rhodri Jones is preparing his prize rams ready for auction. These boys aren’t sold for food, but for breeding, with farmers prepared to pay big bucks for the best rams. To make sure his rams fetch a good price, Rhodri and his wife Claire give their rams the full salon experience. Whilst the other farmers are preparing to send livestock away, Beca Glyn is attempting to bring her cattle home. They’ve been grazing on good quality grass on Anglesey for several months but now it’s time for them to come back to the warmth of the farm sheds. Beca and her father Glyn need to get a few dozen steers to get on to a trailer, but these cattle have other ideas. Back near Ysbyty Ifan, Guto Davies is tending to his highland cattle. This herd are part of a plan to help improve an important natural habitat. Guto is convinced that with schemes like this livestock farmers can do their bit to battle climate change.
