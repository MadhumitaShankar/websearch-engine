My experience in Indian Institute of Management, Kozhikode.

Placements:
I am a 1st-year student. So, I think this question is not applicable to me. Many companies visit the college, and it gives a feeling that placements will not be a problem. Even we had a conversation with the alumni of our college which gave us confidence. All the members here are very supportive. Even the placement committee members are very supportive. Currently, we are focusing on our studies. We have been told not to worry about the placements. We were asked to study hard to make ourselves re...

Many reputed companies like BCG, JP Morgon, Deloitte, ITC etc. Visits our campus for placements. Yes, the college does provide internship for the students in many know companies. It has one of the most transparent placement reports. The placement cell are very good at their job. IIM has very good return on investment that is why it is worth studying here.

Infrastructure:
It is a well planned and have all the modern facilities required by the students. It is situated among the green mountains which makes it a beautiful campus to study.

Apart from being clean and comfortable you get an excellent view from your hostel rooms. No, I have not faced any difficulties regarding...

Learning in the lap of nature.

Placements:
100% placement is guaranteed in IIM Kozhikode. Last year the placement got over within 4 days. Some of the top recruiters were Brain, BCG, McKinsey.

One of the oldest IIM campus with an exemplary placement record.

Placements:
In my batch almost 100% of the studetns were placed in the complies like Amazon, Accenture, Asian paints, Brains and co. etc. Most of them were at a package higher than 15 lacs. The percentage increase in the placement record has been improving each year, especially for a one year course like this one. Many of the students opted for internship in between the course curriculum and was offered paid internships, some of them converted it to placements.

Infrastructure:

IIM Kozhikode - God's own campus.

Placements:
The placements are overall good. Summer placements are of course better than the placements which are during the final exams because most of the companies do not come for the recruitment during the final exams. Big companies like BCG HUL, ITC, Deloitte visit the campus but recruit the students in very small numbers like 5 or 6 students. In this college, mostly 70% of the batch gets placed in reputed companies, and others have to settle for a little less like startup companies.

The college provides excellent placements and experienced faculty.

Placements:
If you are studying at IIM, almost 100% placements are never your concern, but choosing amongst the best is the concern. IIMK witnessed the highest ever mean (20.7 LPA) and median (18.5 LPA) salary packages in its history with the highest domestic salary package being 40.5 LPA. We also joined the elite club of MBB (McKinsey, BCG, Brain) this year with offers in double digits. There were also a couple of international offers, but the placement week wrapped up in a record of 6 days. All the studen...

Indian Institute of Management Kozhikode, Kerala is a beautiful place to be in because of various reasons like weather, place, faculty, placements and many more. Undoubtedly, placements and faculty members are fantastic (5+ stars for them). Harvard and Stanford case studies are a usual practice and summers and finals are hectic. The only problem is the mess food and the distant location of the college. Else, it’s awesome to be in IIMK.
