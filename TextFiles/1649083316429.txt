Onkar reveals why family combined with a serious work ethic has meant immigrants from the Indian subcontinent have excelled in business and transformed the Welsh economy in the process. He starts with the story of his own father. Sukdev arrived in Britain in 1976 with one suitcase and £75 in his pocket. From there, he built up a business empire of a corner shop, a chip shop and a hotel. Onkar also unearths why a fifth of corner shops in Wales are run by Indian immigrants. In the valleys and tight-knit communities outside big cities, Asian immigration helped smooth race relations, but in urban areas it was a different story.
Tea shop owner Kasim Ali grew up in Cardiff in the 1970s, and his parents ran a corner shop. He reveals the racist abuse they suffered and how that affected him growing up. But he also shares how times have changed and talks about the community bonds he has forged in opening up a chain of successful cafes across Cardiff. Onkar takes a crash course in tea making and tea etiquette as he finds out the secrets behind Kasim’s success.
In Colwyn Bay, Onkar rolls up his sleeves to take part in a Bollywood dance session run by entrepreneur Ghazala Jabeen. Pakistani-born, she moved to Colwyn Bay 25 years ago and is now one of a growing number of female Asian entrepreneurs able to spot an opportunity and grow a brand new business. Her Bollywood fitness classes have taken off across north Wales and bagged her a string of awards. She shares how being in Wales made it happen and why she thinks her business has been such a success.
Onkar heads for Cardiff market to try out his sales patter with the Singh family, who have run a mobile phone stall for 30 years. Finally Onkar meets Rakesh Aggarwal who runs Wales’s biggest beauty retailer – a business that started in his parents' garage and is now global. We hear how it employs a huge Welsh workforce and how the business could only have happened in Wales!
